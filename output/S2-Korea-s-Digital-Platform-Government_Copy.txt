(Quick Win Projects) My AI Assistant Service (decision support)

Based on citizen’s consent, AI collects and analyzes data to

preemptively recommend services that citizen can receive.


Can I get unemployment be
nefits?

As-Is

What scholarships can
I get?

To-Be (since March 2021)

① Life cycle events           ② Data-driven eligibility check

Marriage

Employment

Childbirth and
Parenting

③ Customized public service recommendation and provision


“Even though there are various government services that can be received,
many people are unable to receive benefits because they do not know,

or they have to check whether they are eligible for support.”

Pregnancy and Childbirth Support Services

의료E비lec과tric다ity지a출nd Heating Cost Reduction Service

Unemployment Benefits and
Student Loan Assistance Services


(Quick Win Projects) Digital Wallet 24 (shared platforms)

Manage personalized services provided

by the government with one app

•  Development of a digital wallet service that integrates and mana
ges public services such as mobile ID cards, electronic certificates

, various bills, public my data, and welfare service notifications

•  Opening of digital wallet service API to the private sector,
enabling citizens to access services in private platforms such as
Naver, Kakao, and Toss


(Quick Win) Government-wide Data Sharing and Analysis

Support data driven decision-making by gathering, sharing, and analyzing government data in one
place without partitions between government agencies.

•  Establishment of “National Data Sharing Platform” that manages data held by government agencies 
so
that they can be extracted, refined, processed, shared, and utilized

•  Establishment of a pan-governmental data analysis system in which government agencies jointly 
utilize
data analysis resources


Data Infrastructure is essential to Digital Transformation


The increased consumption of data,
especially shared data, has fueled the digital
transformation

Why we need
data infrastructure?

Is data
Universal or Local?


Data Infrastructure needed to significantly reduce data
