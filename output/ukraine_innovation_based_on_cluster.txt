**Practical Implementation Steps (Revised based on examples from the most innovative countries):**

1. **Committee Formation**:
   - Like Finland's *Innovation Council*, create specialized committees for each cluster, inviting industry experts, academics, and stakeholders for a holistic perspective.

2. **Budget Allocation**:
   - Inspired by Sweden's innovative budgeting, prioritize cluster budgets based on data-driven urgency metrics and potential long-term societal and economic benefits.

3. **International Collaboration**:
   - Emulate Singapore's approach in forging partnerships by engaging with international agencies such as UNDP, WHO, and UNESCO for domain expertise, funding mechanisms, and proven methodologies.

5. **Community Engagement**:
   - Drawing from Denmark's success, utilize community-centric platforms and digital portals to engage with citizens, gather feedback, and iteratively refine strategies based on ground-level insights.

6. **Public-Private Synergy**:
   - Following Israel's startup ecosystem model, establish robust public-private partnership frameworks. This ensures capital flow, technology transfers, and expertise sharing, benefiting both entities.

7. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Leveraging South Korea's advanced tech capabilities, deploy an AI-powered central monitoring system, which provides real-time insights on the progress and impact of each strategic initiative.

8. **Policy Dynamics**:
   - Inspired by Germany's adaptive policy environment, ensure that national policies are revisited bi-annually, incorporating global best practices and internal lessons learned post-implementation.
