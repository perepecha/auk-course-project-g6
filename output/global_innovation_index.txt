innovation leaders in 2023
switzerland continues to be the uncontested innovation world champion, singapore makes 
the top five, and indonesia joins china, türkiye, india, the islamic republic of iran and viet 
nam as most impressive innovation climbers of the last decade
for a 13th consecutive year, switzerland ranks first in the gii (figure 10). it is the global leader 
in innovation outputs, ranking first in both knowledge and technology outputs and creative 
outputs. sweden overtakes the united states (us) to climb to second position. sweden leads in 
business sophistication (1st), infrastructure (2nd) and human capital and research (3rd). it holds 
top positions for its researchers (1st) and its knowledge-intensive employment (3rd). the united 
states continues to head the league table of scoring best in the world in 13 of the 80 gii 2023 
innovation indicators (box 1). it is number one in the world in indicators that include global 
corporate r&d investors, venture capital received, the quality of its universities, the combined 
valuation of its unicorn companies (a new gii indicator – box 3), software spending and the 
value of corporate intangible asset intensity.
singapore enters the top five, and takes the leading position among south east asia, east asia 
and oceania (seao) region economies. finland (6th) gets closer to the top five, gaining three 
ranks this year. it comes top worldwide in infrastructure (1st).
denmark (9th) and the republic of korea (10th) remain in the top 10. france (11th) gets closer, 
improving one rank this year, while japan remains strong as the 13th most innovative economy. 
israel re-enters the top 15, reaching 14th place.
after a rapid ascent, gaining 23 positions over the last decade, china ranks 12th this year, 
dropping one rank relative to 2022.1 china remains the sole middle-income economy to secure 
a position among the top 30, retaining 3rd place in the seao region and top spot in the upper 
middle-income group (see figure 11 and table 3). belgium (23rd) re-enters the top 25, climbing 
three ranks.
all eight nordic and baltic economies improved their ranking this year, except for iceland, which 
stays at 20th spot. estonia gains two ranks and edges the top 15, at 16th place. norway (19th) re-
enters the top 20. lithuania (34th) and latvia (37th) make the largest improvements, gaining five 
and four ranks respectively, with latvia re-entering the top 40.
apart from china, there are only four other middle-income economies among the top 40 
economies, namely, malaysia (36th), bulgaria (38th), türkiye (39th) and india (40th).
the united arab emirates stabilizes at 32nd place, close to the top 30. saudi arabia (48th) and 
qatar (50th) make it into the top 50. middle east economies bahrain (67th), oman (69th), jordan 
(71st) and egypt (86th) also experience notable improvements in their innovation ranking – 

global innovation index 2023 51 with bahrain and oman entering the top 70, and jordan just outside. in sum, these are some 
systematic and positive innovation rank developments in the middle east.
brazil (49th) makes it into the top 50 in 2023, following a gradual ascent over recent years, 
overtaking chile (52nd) as the most innovative economy in latin america and the caribbean. 
uruguay (63rd) and el salvador (95th) are the only two other economies within the region that 
improve their ranking in 2023.
thailand (43rd) and viet nam (46th) consolidate their positions in the top 50, while the philippines 
(56th) gets closer. viet nam and the philippines continue marching forward, after a setback 
in 2022, gaining two and three ranks, respectively. indonesia (61st) moves rapidly toward the 
top 60, following a rise over recent years. together with china, india, the islamic republic of 
iran (62nd), the philippines, türkiye and viet nam, indonesia joins the group of middle-income 
economies within the gii top 65 that climbed fastest in the gii ranking over the last decade.
in the last four years, and since the start of the pandemic, mauritius (57th), indonesia, saudi 
arabia, brazil and pakistan ascended most in the gii, in order of their rank progression.
in central and southern asia, kazakhstan (81st) and uzbekistan (82nd) are close to the top 80, 
while pakistan (88th) follows closely, the latter overperforming on innovation once again in 2023.
nine out of the 26 economies from sub-saharan africa (ssa) covered this year improve their 
ranking. south africa (59th) enters the top 60. rwanda (103rd and low-income group leader) 
continues moving ahead. senegal (93rd) and nigeria (109th) take two of the biggest leaps forward. 
excluding island economies, senegal becomes the region’s third most innovative economy in 
2023 (see figure 11).

global innovation index 202352 box 1 gii innovation indicators – 2023 trailblazers
the united states continues to lead in terms of number of gii innovation indicators for which it 
ranks top globally, ranking 1st in the world on 13 out of 80 indicators in 2023.
singapore follows the united states globally and is number one worldwide on 11 indicators, 
the same amount as in 2022, including leading in operational stability for businesses, 
government effectiveness, ict access, logistics performance, venture capital received, high-
tech manufacturing, and github commits. israel follows in 3rd place, leading in nine innovation 
indicators, including r&d expenditure, university–industry r&d collaboration, pct patents and 
ict services exports. switzerland and hong kong, china, tie jointly in 4th place, attaining top 
ranking in patent families and high-tech imports, respectively. they are followed by japan in 6th 
place, leading in production and export complexity.
in addition to the top winners globally, there are middle- and low-income economies excelling 
in various domains. relative to other countries and to its gdp or population, namibia ranks 1st 
in expenditure on education, mozambique in gross capital formation, and cambodia and nepal 
in loans from microfinance institutions. relatively, mauritius leads globally in venture capital 
investors, the islamic republic of iran in trademarks and mongolia in trademarks, as well as 
industrial designs.

box 2 outlines important ‘dos and don’ts’, when using the gii to improve an economy’s 
innovation performance.
box 2 how to best use the global innovation index (gii) and what not to do?
for many years, governments around the world have successfully used the global innovation 
index (gii) to improve their economy’s innovation performance and shape evidence-based 
innovation policies. a survey carried out by wipo in 2022 showed 70 percent of wipo member 
states were using the gii to improve innovation ecosystems and metrics, as well as it being a 
benchmark for national innovation policies or economic strategies. it is heartening to see that 
the gii is being used by a wide range of economies, from low- to high-income, across every one 
of the world’s regions.
one major benefit of the gii is that it puts evidence and metrics at the core of conceiving, 
deploying and evaluating innovation policies. a first step brings together statisticians, 
innovation actors and policymakers in order to understand a country’s innovation 
performance, based on the gii metrics. in a second step, the policy discussion turns to 
leveraging domestic innovation opportunities, while at the same time overcoming country-
specific weaknesses. both steps are an exercise in coordination among different public and 
private innovation actors, as well as between government entities. in select countries, the gii 
has facilitated just such a dialogue across innovation actors and government entities.
some dos:
 –ensure innovation is embedded as a key priority in a country’s pathway to national 
development and progress, possibly formulated within a clear innovation policy.
 –establish a cross-ministerial task force to pursue innovation policy matters through a “whole 
of government approach,” ideally reporting to the top tier of government, for instance, the 
prime minister’s office.
 –ensure any innovation policy task force consults with innovation actors from both the private 
and public sectors, including start-ups, research universities and innovation clusters. the 
private sector, in particular, is key, as is broad representation from manufacturing, services 
and traditional industries, as well as diverse entrepreneurial strands.
 –ensure any national intellectual property (ip) policy is aligned with or even integrated into 
innovation policy.
 –ensure those targets or actions that are part of an innovation policy are quantifiable and can 
be evaluated.

global innovation index 202354 some don’ts:
 –do not set over-ambitious and therefore unrealistic gii ranking targets. gii rankings rarely 
increase in leaps and bounds from one year to the next, particularly at the top.
 –do not expect policy changes to result in immediate improved gii indicator performance. there 
are important lags between the formulation of innovation policy and its execution and impact. 
the latest available innovation data is also rarely current, often lagging by several years.
 –do not treat the gii as a mathematical exercise, that is, by attempting to collect or focus on 
specific indicators simply to climb the rankings. a country’s gii rank alone is only a partial 
reflection of a national innovation ecosystem and related progress. moreover, the gii 
framework changes regularly. do not therefore over focus on year-on-year changes within the 
gii, because these are influenced by relative performance vis-à-vis other countries, together 
with other methodological considerations (see appendix i). setting objectives for a period of 
years – for example, three to five years – and then reviewing combined progress over several 
years is a more appropriate way of using the gii.
with this in mind, the gii has become a catalyst for the national collection of innovation 
indicators. economies have an interest in ensuring the gii can rely on the complete and 
updated innovation metrics they provide. as detailed in appendix iii, the vast majority of gii 
data is not collected by the world intellectual property organization (wipo) itself directly from 
its member states. instead, wipo uses data submitted by economies to those organizations 
globally responsible for a particular data collection (e.g., the unesco institute for statistics 
for data relating to r&d). the sole exception is the intellectual property data wipo collects 
annually from members states.2 for all other data sets, the gii team is able to help countries 
identify missing and outdated data (marked clearly in the economy profiles and briefs) and 
advise data collectors on how to remedy the situation.
finally, a new trend is the interest being expressed by countries in building sub-national 
innovation indices at the regional or city level that mirror the gii framework or comprise 
selected gii indicators (wipo, 2023a). wipo has pledged to support this work in two ways: 
(i) by organizing workshops on the exchange of best practice, and (ii) providing a background 
study on sub-national innovation indices.3 member states are welcome to join this effort.
innovation overperformers
several middle- and low-income economies are performing above expectation on innovation 
relative to their level of economic development
in the gii 2023, 21 economies are performing above expectation relative to their level of 
development – these are the gii innovation overperformers (figure 12 and table 4).
india, the republic of moldova and viet nam continue to be record holders by being innovation 
overperformers for a 13th consecutive year. the republic of moldova (60th) scores above its 
income level in human capital and research (67th), as well as both output pillars – knowledge and 
technology outputs (60th) and creative outputs (42nd). the philippines (56th) and morocco (70th) 
keep their innovation overperformer status for a fifth time.
there are also two notable comebacks this year, namely, senegal (93rd) and north macedonia 
(54th). in addition, indonesia (61st), uzbekistan (82nd) and pakistan (88th) keep their overperformer 
status for a second and brazil (49th) for a third consecutive year.
from a regional perspective, this year there is an equal number of innovation overperformers 
in south east asia, east asia, and oceania, and sub-saharan africa, each region having five 
innovation overperformers. tying in 3rd place, with three overperforming economies each, are 
europe, central and southern asia, and northern africa and western asia. in 6th place is latin 
america and the caribbean, with two innovation overperformers.
conversely, 37 economies are performing below expectation on innovation, the majority from 
latin america and the caribbean (11) and sub-saharan africa (9). among the high-income group, 
three are eastern european economies, namely, poland (41st), slovakia (45th) and romania (47th). 

global innovation index 2023 55 in the upper middle-income group, the six underperformers are latin american and caribbean 
economies argentina (73rd), costa rica (74th), the dominican republic (94th), paraguay (98th), 
ecuador (104th) and guatemala (122nd). all six of these economies also drop down the gii ranking 
in 2023. in the lower middle-income group, nine economies are performing below expectation 
for their level of development, including sub-saharan african economies côte d’ivoire (112th), 
benin (120th), cameroon (123rd), mauritania (127th) and angola (132nd).
relative to 2022, 23 economies have switched performance groups. seven economies have 
raised their performance status from below expectation to matching expectation, namely, 
lithuania (34th), greece (42nd), egypt (86th), el salvador (95th), namibia (96th), nigeria (109th) and 
zambia (118th).

converting innovation investment into tangible innovation output
several middle-income economies are more efficient at translating innovation inputs into 
outputs than their high-income counterparts
among high-income economies, switzerland leads (1st) in producing higher levels of outputs 
compared to sweden (2nd), the united states (3rd) and finland (6th), while germany (8th) produces 
similar output levels to the united states and the kingdom of the netherlands (7th), but with 
lower input levels (figure 13).
among upper middle-income group economies, china (12th) also shines, producing levels 
of outputs comparable to high-income economies like singapore (5th), denmark (9th) and 
france (11th), but with fewer inputs. türkiye (39th) does likewise relative to new zealand (27th) and 
hungary (35th).
among the lower-middle income group, morocco (70th) and pakistan (88th) are efficient 
innovators, while madagascar (107th) stands out among the low-income group.
however, certain economies, including the united arab emirates (32nd), saudi arabia (48th), 
qatar (50th), serbia (53rd), bahrain (67th), peru (76th), and cabo verde (91st), struggle to translate 
inputs into outputs, affecting their overall innovation performance.
this year, canada (15th), norway (19th) and uzbekistan (82nd) have improved in converting inputs 
into outputs, no longer underperforming on this metric.

global innovation index 202360 box 3 who leads on unicorns?
a unicorn company is a privately held startup valued at over usd 1 billion.4 unicorn companies 
exhibit rapid growth. they often disrupt industries by introducing innovative products, services 
or business models that have the potential to reshape entire sectors.
this 2023 edition of the gii includes a new indicator showing the combined valuation of a 
country’s unicorn companies (6.2.2 unicorn valuation, % gdp; see appendix iii).
according to cbinsights’ tracker of unicorn companies, as of april 2023, there were 1,206 
unicorn companies located in 50 different countries globally.5 according to a simple count, 
only five economies host 80 percent of all the world’s unicorns, namely, the united states 
(54 percent), china (14 percent), india (6 percent), the united kingdom (4 percent) and germany 
(2 percent). out of a total unicorn valuation of usd 3.8 trillion in 2023, us unicorns account of 
usd 2 trillion – a huge lead – followed by china at usd 736 billion and india at usd 193 billion.
of the top 25 most valuable unicorn companies and their origin, china comes first, with 
bytedance (1st, artificial intelligence), followed by shein (3rd, e-commerce) and xiaohongshu 
(12th, e-commerce). the united states follows, with spacex (2nd, space and telecommunications), 
stripe (4th, fintech) and epic games (7th, videogames). australia has canva (5th, graphic design 
and software) and indonesia has j&t express (13th, logistics and delivery).
in the gii, the cumulative value of unicorns is scaled by gdp. after scaling, five economies 
tie in first place, namely, estonia, israel, lithuania, senegal and the united states. estonia 
leads with bolt (auto and transportation), israel with wiz (cybersecurity), lithuania has vinted 
(e-commerce) and senegal leads with wave (fintech). these five top hubs for unicorns are 
followed by hong kong, china (6th), the united kingdom (7th), singapore (8th), india (9th) and 
finland (10th).
plotting an economy’s level of development against the cumulative value of its unicorn 
companies shows whether it is overperforming relative to level of development. in the figure 
below, most economies in the upper-right quadrant are in the high-income group. the lower-
right quadrant also contains high-income economies – largely european – but with a lower 
concentration of unicorn companies.

global innovation index 2023 61 the economies in the left-hand quadrants are the most interesting cases. upper-left, middle-
income economies china, india and brazil shine, having a high concentration of unicorn companies 
relative to their level of development. lower left are those middle- and low-income economies 
hosting unicorn companies, even when their valuation is relatively lower. latin american economies 
are the most represented, comprising argentina, chile, colombia, ecuador and mexico, with leading 
unicorns kavak (mexico, e-commerce), rappi (colombia, supply chain) and uala (argentina, fintech).
innovation leaders (top 25) demonstrate balanced and strong performance across all seven 
pillars. they include france (11th), japan (13th), canada (15th), norway (19th), iceland (20th) and 
australia (24th) (table 5). some lower-ranked economies excel in specific innovation pillars, 
such as georgia and rwanda in institutions (25th and 33rd, respectively), trinidad and tobago 
in human capital and research (45th), croatia (44th) in infrastructure (26th), and malaysia and 
thailand in market sophistication (18th and 22nd, respectively). india and slovakia excel in 
knowledge and technology outputs (22nd and 31st, respectively), while türkiye and latvia shine 
in creative outputs (27th and 31st, respectively). these examples showcase the diverse strengths 
of economies vibrant in innovation, which can be nurtured to enhance their overall rankings.
innovation across the world’s regions
south east asia, east asia, and oceania continues to narrow the gap with europe, while 
central and southern asia is getting closer to latin america and the caribbean
for yet another year, there are no changes in the rankings of the world’s regions, based on an 
unweighted average gii score of all economies within a region. northern america and europe 
continue to lead, followed by south east asia, east asia, and oceania (seao). northern africa and 
western asia, latin america and the caribbean, central and southern asia, and sub-saharan africa, 
follow more distantly. however, this year, the distance dividing economies in the seao region from 
those in europe is on average no more than four gii score points, while economies in central and 
southern asia are narrowing the gap between them and those in latin america and the caribbean.
northern america
largely driven by the united states, northern america, comprising the united states and canada, 
is the most innovative world region. canada performs best in market sophistication (4th), human 
capital and research (10th) and institutions (14th). it continues to lead in indicators venture capital 
recipients (1st), the impact of its scientific publications (h-index, 4th) and software spending (5th).
europe
europe still hosts the highest number of innovation leaders among the top 25 – 16 in total, 
one more than in 2022. out of 39 european economies covered, 19 move up the rankings 
this year (seven more than last year), namely, sweden (2nd), finland (6th), denmark (9th), 
france (11th), estonia (16th), norway (19th), ireland (22nd), belgium (23rd), italy (26th), portugal (30th), 
lithuania (34th), latvia (37th), greece (42nd), slovakia (45th), romania (47th), serbia (53rd), north 
macedonia (54th), ukraine (55th) and albania (83rd).
among economies improving, france excels in intangible assets (3rd ), global brands (4th), 
industrial designs (8th) and global corporate r&d investors (9th). top companies like lvmh, l’oreal 
and christian dior are contributing to its success. belgium is performing well in r&d expenditure 
(6th), researchers (8th) and university–industry r&d collaboration (9th). serbia approaches the top 
50 with a strong performance in fdi inflows (11th) and labor productivity growth (14th).
this year, the nordic and baltic economies have made notable progress.
south east asia, east asia, and oceania
the difference in gii scores between the south east asia, east asia, and oceania (seao) region 
and europe continues to diminish. six seao economies are world innovation leaders, namely, 
singapore (5th), the republic of korea (10th), china (12th), japan (13th), hong kong, china (17th) 
and australia (24th). these six economies continue to lead in key innovation indicators. china 
leads globally (1st) in labor productivity growth, japan in production and export complexity, the 
republic of korea in pct patents, australia in school life expectancy, hong kong, china in global 
brand value and singapore in venture capital received.

global innovation index 202362 eight economies within the seao region improve their rankings this year, with indonesia (61st) making 
the greatest advance. indonesia makes marked improvements in innovation outputs, notably in 
knowledge creation and online creativity. it excels in ict-related indicators and ranks among the 
top 10 globally for university–industry r&d collaboration (5th), state of cluster development (5th), 
entrepreneurship policies and culture (5th) and finance for startups and scaleups (8th).
mongolia (68th), brunei darussalam (87th) and the lao people’s democratic republic (110th) also 
move up the rankings.
central and southern asia
within central and southern asia, india continues to lead, maintaining its 40th position overall. india 
leads the lower middle-income group (table 3), performing strongly in every innovation pillar except 
for infrastructure. it holds top ranking within the central and southern asia region for human 
capital and research (48th), business sophistication (57th) and knowledge and technology outputs 
(22nd). strong indicators include ict services exports (5th), venture capital received (6th), graduates in 
science and engineering (11th) and global corporate r&d investors (13th).
the islamic republic of iran is 2nd within the region once again, at 62nd position. it is the regional 
leader in market sophistication (19th) and creative outputs (43rd). it performs well in intangible 
assets (13th), ranks 1st globally in trademarks (1st) and in the top 15 worldwide in graduates in 
science and engineering (3rd), market capitalization (5th) and industrial designs (11th).
kazakhstan (81st) takes over 3rd position within the region, gaining two ranks and displacing 
uzbekistan to 4th, which retains its 82nd position overall. only kazakhstan and nepal (108th) 
within the region go up the rankings. kazakhstan tops in infrastructure (59th), thanks to its good 
performance in government’s online service (8th) and e-participation (15th).
northern africa and western asia  
in northern africa and western asia, israel (14th) has made significant progress this year and 
consistently leads the region as a whole. israel stands out in various areas, holding top position 
in market sophistication (11th), business sophistication (6th) and knowledge and technology 
outputs (5th). furthermore, it distinguishes itself globally as the one country that allocates over 
5 percent of gdp to r&d, with a remarkable expenditure of 5.6 percent in 2021.
saudi arabia (48th) enters the top 50, leading globally in ict access (7th), ict use (10th) and policies 
for doing business (16th). it also excels for its global corporate r&d investors (16th) and for its 
global brand value (18th), thanks to leaders aramco (oil and gas), stc (telecoms) and al-rajhi 
bank (banking). oman also takes a big leap forward this year by achieving 69th place, and ranks 
among the top 10 worldwide in graduates in science and engineering (2nd) and government 
funding per pupil (9th).

for firms offering formal training (15th) and trademarks (20th).
this year, brazil and jamaica continue to perform above expectation for their level of 
development (table 4). conversely, the performance status of costa rica (74th) has declined, 
no longer meeting expectation but instead performing below expectation for its level 
of development.
sub-saharan africa
in sub-saharan africa, only mauritius (57th) and south africa (59th) rank among the top 60, with 
south africa entering this group having gained two ranks since last year. six of the region’s

box 4 innovation as the driver of the united nations sustainable development goals
the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, with its 17 sustainable development goals 
(sdgs), has set an ambitious agenda. while technology and innovation are a recognized key 
facilitator in achieving all related targets, innovation is a specific policy target in its own right. 
sdg 9 specifically targets innovation-related goals, in particular target 9.5, which promotes 
increasing r&d expenditure as a proportion of gdp (9.5.1), and increasing the number of 
researchers per million inhabitants (9.5.2), both of which are also important gii indicators.6
in this context, the gii has been recognized an authoritative benchmark for measuring 
innovation within the 2019 and 2021 un general assembly resolutions on science, technology 
and innovation for sustainable development. events such as the eighth annual multi-
stakeholder forum on science, technology and innovation for the sdgs (sti forum) held this 
year in may 2023 concern the role that can be played by innovation in accelerating the post-
pandemic recovery.7
looking forward, around the time of the gii launch in september 2023, an sdg summit is due 
to be convened during the high-level week of the un general assembly marking the mid-way 
point in the agenda – which has seven more years to run – and to accelerate action during the 
lead up to 2030.8

global innovation index 202364 conclusion
several key insights emerge from this year’s gii report.
 –the global innovation landscape is changing at this time of pandemic and recovery and 
geopolitical upheaval, not only within the group of leading innovation economies, but 
more widely. as a result, some of the changes in gii rank this year may partly reflect short 
rather than longer term trends. the most notable changes to the innovation landscape are 
as follows:
 –there has been a shift within this year’s top 20 innovators, with sweden, singapore, 
finland, denmark, france and israel (in order of their ranking) moving up the ranking, 
and generally a strong showing by the nordic and baltic countries.
 –there is a mixed picture for leading emerging economies, with indonesia rising fast over 
recent years, the philippines and viet nam progressing again and india stable, but with 
china, türkiye and the islamic republic of iran falling back slightly, possibly in part due 
to recent covid-19 induced effects.
 –india, the republic of moldova and viet nam have overperformed on innovation 
relative to development for a 13th year in a row, with indonesia, uzbekistan and 
pakistan maintaining the overperformer status they first achieved in 2022, and brazil 
overperforming on innovation relative to development for a third consecutive year.
 –there are some systematically positive innovation ranking developments in the middle 
east, with the united arab emirates (uae) close to the top 30, and saudi arabia, qatar, 
bahrain, oman and other neighboring countries progressing up the rankings.
 –mauritius and south africa are leading sub-sahara africa, with solid positions in the gii 
top 60, and a total of five economies within the region overperforming on innovation, 
with rwanda having done so for the longest.
 –similar to last year, and excepting those economies just mentioned, more middle- and low-
income economies would benefit from more a systematic and gradual improvement to the 
set-up and performance of their innovation ecosystem.
 –today, more than ever, pandemic impacts, downward pressure on risk capital, high interest 
rates and high debt levels, together with the effects of disruption to global supply chains 
on nascent innovation systems in middle- and low-income economies, all need close 
monitoring. this is to preserve the many positive changes that have come about over the 
last two decades in terms of getting innovation systems and policies onto the agenda of 
developing countries’ policymakers, legislators and innovation actors. closely monitoring 
the evolution of innovation is key also in the sdg context (see box 4).
future editions of the gii will continue to track developments closely – and innovation 
impacts, in particular – with the aim of fostering a better understanding of innovation and its 
measurement. future editions will tell us which of the gii performance changes at the country 
or regional level listed above are transitory and which longer term in nature.

analyses the existing sub-national innovation indices of wipo member states who have pioneered this field. it also 
determines which future innovation metrics are applicable to the measurement of innovation at the sub-national 
level, particularly those exploiting “big data” and new computational methods. see wipo (2023a).

cluster ranking
the gii reveals the world’s 
top 100 science and 
technology (s&t) clusters 
and identifies the most s&t-
intensive top global clusters.

global innovation index 202368 the gii 2023 top 100 science and technology clusters
recognizing that innovation output at the local level is equally as important as output at the 
national level, the global innovation index (gii) continues to chart the world’s largest top 100 
science and technology (s&t) clusters (see map 1). these are the geographical areas around the 
world where the highest density of inventors and scientific authors are located (see appendix iv 
for details on the methodological adjustment employed).
for a second time, the gii 2023 also presents s&t clusters beyond the top 100, shedding light on 
clusters not normally highlighted within this section.
tokyo–yokohama and four other asian clusters lead the top 100 s&t clusters
among the top 100, tokyo–yokohama (japan) is the top performing cluster, followed by 
shenzhen–hong kong–guangzhou (china and hong kong, china), seoul (republic of korea), 
beijing (china) and shanghai–suzhou (china).
seoul (republic of korea) climbs one place to third in the rankings overtaking beijing (china) in 
fourth, in 2023.1
shanghai–suzhou (china) rises one place to enter the top 5, primarily owing to a strong growth 
in pct filings. san jose–san francisco, ca (united states) follows in sixth position.2
the four remaining top 10 clusters are unchanged on the previous year, with the exception of 
san diego, ca, which climbs two places from 11th to 9th with new york city, ny dropping a place 
to 10th and paris two places to 12th.

note: noise refers to all inventor/author locations not classified in a cluster.
the highest climbers in the ranking are three clusters in china, namely, zhenjiang 
(+15 positions), hefei (+13) and wuxi (+13). following significant growth, wuxi and zhenjiang, 
together with another chinese cluster, fuzhou (+8 positions) enter the top 100 for the first time.
it is clusters in china that have recorded the largest increases in s&t output in 2023, the median 
increase equating to +12.1 percent, with that economy hosting the two fastest growing clusters 
globally – hefei (+21.6 percent) and qingdao (+19.4 percent).3
clusters located in other middle-income economies besides china also experienced strong s&t 
output growth, four of which were in india, namely, chennai (+10.3), bengaluru (+7.9 percent), 
mumbai (+7.1 percent) and delhi (+5.4 percent).
high-income economy clusters generally grew at a slower pace than clusters in middle-income 
economies, with 26 out of the 67 high-income clusters actually experiencing negative net s&t 

global innovation index 2023 69 output for the period. that said, there are some notable exceptions to this trend among high-
income economy clusters. in addition to san diego, ca (+7.5 percent) and seoul (+6.4 percent) 
already highlighted, daejeon (republic of korea, +7.8 percent), denver, co (united states, +4.4 
percent), rome (italy, +4.0 percent) and milan (italy, +3.7 percent) all experienced strong s&t 
output in comparison to other high-income clusters.
the top s&t clusters for each economy or cross-border region are shown in table 6. the leading 
clusters per country remain unchanged from last year, except for munich overtaking cologne to 
become the leading german s&t cluster.
the cluster around singapore now encapsulates johor bahru, malaysia, which lies to the north of 
singapore, with a significant amount of daily commuting occurring from malaysia to singapore.

china overtook the united states in number of top 100 s&t clusters
in 2023, as in previous years, the top 100 s&t clusters are concentrated in three regions, namely, 
northern america, europe and asia, and more specifically in two countries: china and the 
united states (see map 1).
for the first time, in 2023, china is the economy that has the most clusters (24) ranked among 
the top 100, overtaking the united states with 21 clusters unchanged on the year (see table 7). 
germany follows, with nine clusters in the top 100, with munich now that economy’s number 
one cluster followed by cologne and stuttgart. japan has four clusters in the top 100, with 
tokyo–yokohama (1st) and osaka–kobe–kyoto (7th) ranking among the top 10 clusters. france 
has three clusters in the top 100.

beyond the top 100, bangkok, buenos aires, cairo, kuala lumpur and mexico city are top 
middle-income economy s&t clusters
based on the same parameters applied to produce the top 100 ranking s&t clusters globally, 
the gii 2023 has been able to identify clusters beyond the top 100. in all, 137 additional clusters 
were identified beyond the top 100, including 24 clusters based in the united states, 16 in china 
and 11 in each of france and the united kingdom.

global innovation index 202372 table 8 identifies top s&t clusters in economies not covered previously in the top 100, including 
portugal and saudi arabia, which each had two clusters. two economies not previously 
identified as having an s&t cluster are pakistan at islamabad, mainly driven by academic 
publications by quaid-i-azam university, and slovenia at ljubljana, mainly driven by publications 
by the university of ljubljana.

middle-income economies, argentina, egypt, mexico, pakistan, serbia and thailand all host a top 
s&t cluster in the extended list, namely, buenos aires, cairo, mexico city, islamabad, belgrade 
and bangkok, respectively.
s&t intensity of the top 100 clusters: europe and the united states occupy the top 5 spots, with 
cambridge (united kingdom) and san jose–san francisco, ca (united states) out in the lead
since 2020, the gii has also presented the top 100 clusters ranked by s&t intensity, that is, the 
sum of their patent and scientific publication shares divided by population. this work draws on 
geospatial imagery in order to estimate the underlying population level (see appendix iv).
cambridge in the united kingdom and san jose–san francisco, ca, in the united states 
were found to be the two most s&t-intensive clusters, followed by oxford (united kingdom), 
eindhoven (kingdom of the netherlands) and boston–cambridge, ma (united states) (see table 
9). the most intensive s&t clusters are primarily located in europe and the united states (see 
map 3).

global innovation index 202374 daejeon (republic of korea) is the highest-ranking asian s&t cluster by intensity.
only three clusters were in the global top 10 and simultaneously in the top 10 for intensity, 
all in the united states, namely, san jose–san francisco, ca, boston–cambridge, ma and san 
diego, ca.
cambridge produced the most scie articles per capita, at just over 37,000 per one million people 
(see appendix table 4). it was closely followed by oxford and ann arbor, mi (united states). 
eindhoven leads on pct filings per inhabitant, producing roughly 7,700 per one million people, 
followed by san jose–san francisco, ca.

seen through a lens focused on intensity, many clusters in europe and the united states are 
seen to exhibit s&t activity that is more intensive than their asian counterparts (see map 3 and 
table 9). the united states has eight clusters in the top 25 measured by s&t intensity. following 
behind the united states is germany, with three clusters in the top 25 (with munich moving 
up rapidly to 10th spot), while the following four countries each have two clusters: the united 
kingdom (with cambridge and oxford holding two of the top 3 rankings by intensity), japan 
(with kanazawa and tokyo–yokohama both improving their ranking), the republic of korea (with 
seoul entering into the top 25) and sweden (with lund–malmö dropping out of the top 25).
clusters located in china show a relatively weaker performance, with regards to s&t intensity. 
however, there is one exception: beijing. with a population estimated at almost 20 million, 
beijing ranks 14th by intensity, mid-way between the smaller metropolises of göteborg (13th) 
and stockholm (15th) located in sweden. apart from beijing, there is no other s&t cluster located 
in china or any other middle-income economy that ranks among the top 25 most intensive 
clusters globally.
india, however, does make it into the top 100 by s&t intensity for four clusters: bengaluru, 
chennai, delhi and mumbai.

global innovation index 202378 how to read the economy profiles
the following tables provide detailed profiles for each of the 132 economies in the 
global innovation index 2023 . they are composed of four sections.
1 at the top is the overall global innovation index (gii) rank for each economy.
2 next are the key metrics for each profile which provide the specific context for 
that particular economy: namely, its innovation input and output sub-index rankings, 
the income group to which the economy belongs, its geographical region,1 population 
in millions,2 gdp in billion usd purchasing power parity (ppp ), and, lastly, gdp per 
capita in usd ppp.3
because economies may either drop in or out of the gii, and due to adjustments 
made to the gii framework every year and other technical factors unrelated to 
actual performance (missing data, updates of data, and so on), the gii rankings are 
not directly comparable between one year and another. appendix i provides 
further details.
the innovation input sub-index rank is computed based on a simple 
average of the scores in the first five pillars, while the innovation 
output sub-index rank is computed based on a simple average of 
the scores in the last two pillars. scores are normalized values falling 
within the 0–100 range.
3 pillars are identified by an illustrative icon, sub-pillars by two-
digit and indicators by three-digit numbers. for example, under 
the pillar institutions  is the sub-pillar 1.3, business environment, 
under which is indicator 1.3.2, entrepreneurship policies and culture.
the gii 2023 includes 80 indicators in total and three types of data. 
composite (or index) indicators are identified with an asterisk (*), 
survey questions with a dagger (†). the remaining indicators are all 
hard data series.
as far as possible, we have provided the (scaled/unscaled) value of the 
indicators rather than the score. indicators based on survey responses (five 
indicators) or an index (11 indicators) are always reported as scores, while nine of the 
64 hard data indicators are likewise reported as scores. this means that, overall, 55 out 
of 80 indicators are reported as values in the economy profiles.
when data are either unavailable or out of date, “n/a” is used, with a cutoff year of 2013. 
to the right of an indicator name, a clock symbol   is used when the available economy 
data are older than the base year. for information on data exceptions and limitations 
and a detailed explanation of the gii framework, see appendix i. for further details on 
indicator sources and definitions, see appendix iii.
4 on the far right of each column, the strengths of an economy are indicated by a 
solid circle ⚫ and weaknesses by a hollow circle ⚪. the strengths of an economy within 
its income group are indicated by a solid diamond ◆ and weaknesses by a hollow 
diamond ◇. the exceptions to this are the top 25 high-income economies, whose 
strengths and weaknesses are instead computed within the top 25 group.4
rankings of 1, 2 and 3 are highlighted as an economy’s strengths, except in particular 
instances at the sub-pillar level, when the desired data minimum coverage (dmc) is 
unmet for that sub-pillar. for the remaining indicators, the strengths and weaknesses 
of a specific economy are based on the percentage of economies whose scores fall 
either above or below its own score (i.e., percentile ranks) and where the data is no 
older than the indicator mode minus 5 years. in practice, this means that for indicators 
with a data year mode of 2022, an economy’s data year must date from 2017 or be 
more recent in order to classify as a strength or weakness.
notes: ª  indicates a strength; ň  a weakness; è  an income group strength; é  an income group weakness; * an index; † a survey question. ա indicates 
that the economy’s data are older than the base year; see a ppendix iv for details, including the year of the data, at http://globalinnovationindex.org. 
square brackets [ ] indicate that the data minimum covera ge (dmc) requirements were not met at the sub-pillar or pillar le vel.the global innovation index 20231

global innovation index 2023 79 for any given economy, strengths ⚫ are those scores with percentile ranks greater than the 10th 
largest percentile rank among the 80 indicators for that economy.
for that same economy, weaknesses ⚪ are those scores with percentile ranks lower than the 10th 
smallest percentile rank among the 80 indicators for that economy.
similarly, for any given economy, income group strengths ◆ are those scores above the income 
group average plus the standard deviation within that group.
for that same economy, income group weaknesses ◇ are those scores below the income group 
average minus the standard deviation within that group.
in addition, economies with a sub-pillar that does not meet the dmc requirement will show the 
score for that sub-pillar within square brackets. those with more than one such sub-pillar also 
include the ranks for that pillar within square brackets. for these pillars and sub-pillars, neither 
strengths nor weaknesses are signaled.
a complete explanation of the methodology for the calculation of strengths and weaknesses is 
available in appendix i.
notes
1 economies are classified according to the world bank income group classification (july 2022, see https://unstats.
un.org/unsd/methodology/m49 ). geographical regions correspond to the united nations’ publication on standard 
country or area codes for statistical use (m49), as follows: eur = europe; nac = northern america; lcn = latin america 
and the caribbean; csa = central and southern asia; seao = south east asia, east asia, and oceania; nawa = northern 
africa and western asia; ssa = sub-saharan africa.
2 data are from the united nations, department of economic and social affairs, population division, world population 
prospects: 2022 revision.
3 data for gdp and gdp per capita are from the international monetary fund’s world economic outlook database: 
october 2022 edition.
4 as the only economy in the top 25 that does not fall within the high-income group, china’s income group strengths and 
weaknesses are computed within the non-top 25 group.

global innovation index 2023 213 appendix i
conceptual and measurement framework of the global innovation 
index
rationale and origins
the global innovation index (gii) was launched in 2007 with the aim of identifying and 
determining metrics and methods that could capture a picture of innovation in society that is as 
complete as possible.
there were several motivations for setting this goal. first, innovation is important for driving 
economic progress and competitiveness – for both developed and developing economies. 
many governments are putting innovation at the center of their growth strategies. second, 
the definition of innovation has broadened – it is no longer restricted to research and 
development (r&d) laboratories and published scientific papers. the concept of innovation 
has become more general and horizontal in nature, and now includes social, business model 
and technical aspects. last, but not least, recognizing and celebrating innovation in emerging 
markets is critical for inspiring people – especially the next generation of entrepreneurs 
and innovators.
now in its 16th edition, the gii helps to create an environment in which these innovation 
factors are subject to continual evaluation. it provides a key tool for decision-makers and a 
rich database of detailed metrics, offering a convenient source of information for refining 
innovation policies.
measuring innovation outputs and their impact remains a challenging task, hence great 
emphasis is placed on measuring the climate and infrastructure for innovation and assessing 
related outcomes.
although the final results are presented as a ranking, the primary aim of the gii is to improve 
the “journey” to more accurate methods of measurement, understanding innovation and 
identifying targeted policies, good practices and other levers that foster innovation. the rich 
data metrics, at index, sub-index or indicator level, can be used to monitor performance over 
time and to benchmark developments against economies within the same region or income 
group classification.
defining innovation in the gii
the gii adopts a broad definition of innovation, originally elaborated in the oslo manual 
developed by the statistical office of the european communities and the organisation for 
economic co-operation and development (oecd). in its fourth edition, in 2018, the oslo manual 
introduced a more general definition of innovation:1
“an innovation is a new or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that 
differs significantly from the unit’s previous products or processes and that has been 
made available to potential users (product) or brought into use by the unit (process).”
this update of the oslo manual also introduced a series of definitions associated with innovation 
in business activities and for different types of innovation firms. in this context, innovation 
translates as improvements made to outcomes in the form of either new goods or new services, 
or any combination of these. while the gii focuses on a more general definition of innovation, it 
is important to highlight how these specific definitions capture the evolution of the way in which 
innovation has been perceived and understood over the past two decades.
economists and policymakers previously focused on r&d-based technological product 
innovation, largely produced in-house and mainly in manufacturing industries. innovation 
of this nature was executed by a highly educated labor force in r&d-intensive companies. 
the process leading to such innovation was conceptualized as closed, internal and localized. 
technological breakthroughs were necessarily “radical” and took place at the “global knowledge 
frontier.” this characterization implied the existence of leading and lagging economies, with 
low- or middle- income economies only able to play “catch-up.”

global innovation index 2023214 today, innovation capability is increasingly seen as the ability to exploit new technological 
combinations; it embraces the concept of incremental innovation and “innovation without 
research.”  non-r&d  innovative  expenditure  is an important  component  of reaping  the rewards  
of technological innovation. interest in understanding how innovation evolves in low- and 
middle- income economies is increasing, along with an awareness that incremental forms of 
innovation can impact development.
furthermore, the process of innovation itself has changed significantly. investment in 
innovation-related activity and intangible assets has intensified consistently at the firm, 
economy and global levels, adding both new innovation actors from outside high-income 
economies and non-profit actors. the structure of knowledge production activity is more 
complex, collaborative and geographically dispersed than  ever.2
a key challenge is to find metrics that capture innovation as it actually happens in the world 
today. direct official measures that quantify innovation outputs remain extremely scarce. for 
example, there are no official statistics on the amount of innovative activity – defined as the 
number of new products, processes or other innovations – for any given innovation actor, 
let alone for any given country. most measurements also struggle to appropriately capture 
the innovation outputs of a wider spectrum of innovation actors, such as users or the public 
and services sectors, or more informal means, which are often the drivers of innovation in 
developing countries.3
the gii aims to improve the measurement of innovation in order to provide a more complete 
picture of innovation ecosystems across the globe. it explores new metrics regularly to reflect 
the changing nature of innovation and the increasingly sprawling field of new (big data) 
innovation indicators.
since its inception, the gii has also made a special effort to cover creativity and creative 
outputs, taking a fresh view of the previously siloed approach to innovation versus creativity. in 
the opinion of the gii editors, innovation and creativity are simply two faces of the same coin.
interest in applying the gii framework and indicators to develop complementary and mutually 
reinforcing sub-national innovation indices is also growing among wipo member states.4 wipo 
has been supporting these exercises since 2022.
finally, since 2021, when wipo became the sole editor of the gii, the gii team at wipo has 
developed a robust data infrastructure for the gii – led by gii co-editor lorena rivera león – 
increasing the data quality and data quality control, and the robustness and replicability of the 
gii model (appendix box 1).
appendix box 1 building a robust data infrastructure for the global innovation index
to facilitate and permit a comprehensive workflow of the gii model, from data storage to the 
gii calculations, a new data infrastructure was developed in 2021, after wipo became solely 
responsible for the gii. the data infrastructure comprises three parts.
 –data storage – the gii database: all gii data are stored, maintained and managed in the gii 
database. the database stores all collected data in a structured manner for all wipo member 
states (not only the ranked gii economies) and for all indicators (those already included in the 
gii model and the new ones). it also stores data on outlier analysis (generated by the data 
quality checks that the gii team carries out after data collection – see below), as well as all the 
data queries sent to the gii data providers following an outlier analysis.
 –the gii repository of collaborative codes: the gii repository of collaborative codes is 
on github, which is one of the largest code-hosting platforms for version control and 
collaboration. the gii repository contains eight repositories in the statistical programming 
language r (r-codes), which are linked to diverse elements of the gii workflow and the gii 
report, enabling data collection, data calculation and data quality control of all gii indicators.
 –the gii r-package for the calculation of the gii model: the gii r-package is a custom-built 
package of tools, created using r, to calculate the gii model and analyze its results. the 
structure of the tailor-made gii r-package follows the general coinr r-package, which was 

global innovation index 2023 215 developed by the european commission joint research centre (jrc) and follows the steps in 
the oecd/jrc handbook for constructing composite indicators.5
assuring data quality control is at the center of the gii methodology and processes. each 
collected indicator for the gii undergoes a data quality control and data audit process every 
year. several data tests and analyses are performed on all collected indicators, including the 
analysis of means, identification of outliers based on mean and z-scores for both unscaled 
and scaled data, analysis of rank changes, analysis of missing data and analysis of outdated 
data. following these analyses, the gii team goes back to the data providers for any necessary 
clarification and, when required, the data providers themselves correct the data at the source. 
these additional exhaustive checks ensure the reliability of all data used in the gii.
this new infrastructure enables a complete workflow that links data storage and data quality 
control with data analysis (gii rankings and the gii report) in a fully integrated way, increasing 
the overall robustness of the gii data and model.
the gii conceptual framework
the overall gii ranking is based on two sub-indices that are both equally important in 
presenting a  complete  picture  of innovation:  the innovation  input  sub-index  and the innovation  
output  sub-index. hence, three indices are  calculated:
 –innovation input sub-index: five input pillars capture elements of the economy that enable 
and facilitate innovative activities. the idea is that the innovation inputs of today – and 
corresponding efforts to develop the science, innovation and human capital base, and 
the associated innovation environment – prepare the ground for the innovation outputs 
of tomorrow.
 –innovation output sub-index: innovation outputs are the result of innovative activities 
within the economy. although the output sub-index includes only two pillars, it carries the 
same weight as the input sub-index in calculating the overall gii scores. in other words, 
innovation output pillars and indicators have a disproportionally greater weight compared 
to innovation inputs.
 –the overall gii score is the average of the input and output sub-indices, from which the gii 
economy rankings are produced.
each of the five input and two output pillars is divided into three sub-pillars, each of which is 
composed of individual indicators – a total of 80 this year (see the economy profiles section for 
the framework of the global innovation index 2023). each sub-pillar is calculated by  taking  the 
weighted  average  of its individual  indicators’  scores,  which  are normalized  to again produce 
scores between 0 and 100. pillar scores are calculated using the weighted average of each pillar’s 
sub-pillar  scores.
adjustments to the gii model in 2023
appendix table 1 summarizes the adjustments made to the gii 2023 framework. three 
indicators have undergone methodology changes. in addition, there is one new indicator 
and two indicators have been dropped from the framework. furthermore, one indicator has 
shifted its position in the indicator framework, changing sub-pillars. due to the removal of two 
indicators, the numbering of two remaining indicators has been adjusted, but without altering 
their methodology. lastly, the names of three indicators and one sub-pillar have been modified.

data limitations and treatment
this year, the gii model includes 132 economies, which represent 92.5 percent of the 
world’s population and 97.6 percent of the world’s gdp in purchasing power parity current 
international dollars.
the timeliest possible indicators are used for the gii 2023: from the non-missing data, 
3.8 percent are from 2023, 34.7 percent are from 2022, 34.2 percent are from 2021, 15.1 percent 
are from 2020, 5.1 percent are from 2019, 2.8  percent are from 2018 and the small remainder of 
4.2 percent are from earlier years.6
the gii 2023 model includes 80 indicators, which fall into three categories:
 –quantitative/objective/hard data (64 indicators);
 –composite indicators/index data (11 indicators); and
 –survey/qualitative/subjective/soft data (5 indicators).
this year, for an economy to feature in the gii 2023, the minimum symmetric data coverage 
requirement is at least 36 indicators in the innovation input sub-index (66 percent) and 17 
indicators in the innovation output sub-index (66 percent), with scores for at least two sub-
pillars per pillar. in the gii 2023, 132 economies had sufficient data available to be included in 
the index. a total of 61 economies did not make it into the gii 2023 due to a lack of available 
data. for each economy, only the most recent yearly data were considered. as a rule, the gii 
indicators consider data from as far back as 2013.
missing values
for the sake of transparency and replicability of results, missing values are not estimated; they 
are indicated with “n/a” and are not considered in the sub-pillar score. in other words, missing 
indicators do not translate into a zero for the country in question; the indicator is simply not 
taken into consideration in the aggregation process.
that said, the audit undertaken by the european commission’s competence centre on 
composite indicators and scoreboards at the joint research centre (jrc-coin) (see appendix ii) 
assesses the robustness of the gii modeling choices (no imputation of missing data, fixed 
predefined weights and arithmetic averages) by imputing missing data, applying random sets 
of perturbed weights and using geometric averages. since 2012, based on this assessment, a 
confidence interval has been provided for each ranking in the gii as well as for the input and 
output sub-indices (appendix ii).

global innovation index 2023 217 treatment of series with outliers
potentially  problematic  indicators  with  outliers  that could  polarize  results  and unduly  bias the 
rankings  were  treated  according  to the rules  listed  below,  as per the recommendations  of the 
jrc-coin.  only  hard  data  indicators  were  treated  (34 out of 64).
first rule: selection
indicators were classified as problematic if they had:
 –an absolute value of skewness greater than 2.25; and
 –kurtosis greater than 3.5.7
second rule: treatment
indicators with between one and five outliers (27 cases) were winsorized; the values distorting 
the indicator distribution were assigned the next highest value, up to the level where skewness 
and/or kurtosis had the values specified above.8
indicators with five or more outliers, and for which skewness or kurtosis did not fall within the 
ranges specified above, were transformed using natural logarithms after multiplication by a 
given factor f.9 since only “goods” were affected (i.e., indicators for which higher values indicate 
better outcomes, as opposed to “bads”), the following formula was used:
ln (max  × f − 1) ( economy value  − min)
 + 1 max − min
where “min” and “max” are the minimum and maximum indicator sample values, respectively.10
normalization
the 80 indicators were then normalized into the [0, 100] range, with higher scores representing 
better outcomes. normalization was undertaken according to the min–max method, where the 
“min” and “max” values were the minimum and maximum indicator sample values, respectively. 
following the recommendation of the jrc-coin, all indicators, including index and survey data, 
were normalized to a 0–100 range. this normalization ensures that all indicators share the same 
range, facilitating their individual contribution to the overall index score.
weights
in 2012, the jrc-coin and gii team made a joint decision that scaling coefficients of 0.5 or 1.0 
should be used instead of importance coefficients. this decision aimed to achieve balanced 
sub-pillar and pillar scores by considering the underlying components. in other words, the goal 
was to ensure that indicators and sub-pillars contribute a similar amount of variance to their 
respective sub-pillars/pillars.
to prevent multicollinearity during the aggregation process, any indicators within a sub-index 
that exhibited a high correlation, exceeding an absolute correlation of 0.95, were assigned 
a weight of 0.5. in 2023, two indicators have a weight of 0.5 – 1.2.1 regulatory quality and 
1.2.2 rule of law – both of which fall within the input sub-pillar 1.2 regulatory environment. 
additionally, two sub-pillars – 7.2 creative goods and services and 7.3 online creativity – were 
also assigned a weight of 0.5.
strengths and weaknesses
strengths and weaknesses are calculated for all economies covered in the gii and are presented 
in the individual economy profiles (see the explanatory section economy profiles). in simple 
terms, strengths and weaknesses are the top- and bottom-ranked indicators for each country. 
in addition, income group strengths and weaknesses are also provided, which are the respective 
high- and low-performing indicators within income groups.

global innovation index 2023218 the methodology for the calculation of strengths and weaknesses is as follows:
 –the scores of each indicator are converted to percentile ranks.
 –strengths are defined as the indicators of an economy that have a percentile rank greater 
than or equal to the 10th percentile rank (across the indicators of that economy). note that 
this can result in more than 10 strengths in the event of tied results.
 –weaknesses are defined in an equivalent manner for the bottom 10 indicators.
 –if a country has an indicator that ranks equal to or lower than three, it is automatically a 
strength, regardless of the percentile rank.
 –importantly, although the cut-off value used to define the strengths (i.e., the 10th highest 
percentile rank) is calculated using only indicator percentile ranks, it is also applied to sub-
pillars and pillars.
 –in addition, for pillars and sub-pillars that do not meet the data minimum coverage (dmc) 
criteria, strengths and weaknesses are not signaled. pillars and sub-pillars that do not meet 
the dmc show the pillars and sub-pillars in brackets in the economy profiles.
 –income group strengths and weaknesses are somewhat similar to overall strengths and 
weaknesses but are defined within income groups and use means and standard deviations. 
the methodology for the calculation of income group strengths and weaknesses is as follows:
 –for a given economy, income group strengths are those scores that are above the 
income group average plus the standard deviation within the group.
 –for that economy, weaknesses are those scores that are below the income group 
average minus the standard deviation within the group.
 –the only exceptions to the income group strengths and weaknesses are the top 25 high-
income economies, where these strengths and weaknesses are computed within the top 
25 group.
 –as the only non-high-income economy in the top 25, china’s income group strengths and 
weaknesses are computed within the non-top 25 group.
 –since, occasionally, the low threshold for weaknesses is below zero, any score of zero is 
automatically marked as a weakness.
 –finally, as of 2023 and following the recommendation of the audit by the wipo internal 
oversight section,11 strengths and weaknesses are reset, or not signaled, where the data 
year for a given indicator is older than the indicator mode minus five years. in practice, for 
the gii 2023, this means that for indicators with a data year mode of 2022, the data year of 
an economy must be 2017 or later to qualify as a strength or weakness.
caveats on the year-to-year comparison of rankings
the gii compares the performance of national innovation systems across economies and 
presents the changes in economy rankings over time.
it is important to note that scores and rankings are not directly comparable between one year 
and another. each ranking reflects the relative position of a particular economy based on the 
conceptual framework, the data coverage and the sample of economies of that specific gii 
edition, and also reflects changes in the underlying indicators at source and in data availability.
a number of factors influence the year-on-year rankings of an economy:
 –the actual performance of the economy in question;
 –adjustments made to the gii framework (changes in indicator composition and 
measurement revisions);
 –data updates, the treatment of outliers and missing values; and
 –the inclusion or exclusion of economies in the sample.
additionally, the following characteristics complicate the time-series analysis based on simple 
gii rankings or scores:
 –missing values : the gii produces relative index scores, which means that a missing value 
for one economy affects the index score of other economies. because the number of 
missing values decreases every year, this problem reduces over time.
 –reference year : the data underlying the gii do not refer to a single year but to several 
years, depending on the latest available year for any given variable. in addition, the 

global innovation index 2023 219 reference years for different variables are not the same for each economy, due to measures 
to limit the number of missing data points.
 –scaling factors : most gii variables are scaled using either gdp or population, with the 
intention of enabling cross-economy comparability. however, this implies that year-on-year 
changes in individual indicators may be driven either by the variable (numerator) or by its 
scaling factor (denominator).
 –consistent data collection : measuring the change in year-on-year performance relies 
on the consistent collection of data over time. changes in the definition of variables or 
in the data collection process could create movements in the rankings that are unrelated 
to performance.
a detailed economy study based on the gii database and the economy profile over time, 
coupled with analytical work on the ground, including that of innovation actors and decision-
makers, yields the best results in terms of monitoring an economy’s innovation performance, as 
well as identifying possible avenues for improvement.

6 the gii is calculated based on 9,403 data points out of a possible 10,560 (132 economies multiplied by 80 indicators), 
implying that 10.9 percent of data points are missing. the gii 2023 database includes the data year used for each 
indicator and economy, downloadable at www.wipo.int/global_innovation_index/en/2023 . if an indicator for an 
economy is missing, it is marked as “n/a” in the economy profiles.
7 based on groeneveld and meeden (1984), which sets the criteria of absolute skewness above 1 and kurtosis above 
3.5. the skewness criterion was relaxed to accommodate the small sample under consideration (132 economies).
8 the indicators treated using winsorization are: 4.2.1, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.3.2, 6.1.5, 7.2.2 and 7.3.1 (one outlier); 2.2.3, 3.2.1, 
5.3.3, 6.1.3, 7.2.1 and 7.3.3 (two outliers); 4.1.3, 4.2.4, 6.3.4, 7.1.2 and 7.3.2 (three outliers); 4.2.3, 5.3.1 and 6.2.2 (four 
outliers); and 4.3.3, 5.2.5, 6.1.2, 6.3.1 and 7.2.4 (five outliers). finally, indicator 7.1.1 was winsorized from the bottom of 
the distribution, on three outlier observations.
9 indicators 2.3.3, 4.2.2, 5.3.4, 6.1.1, 6.3.3, 7.1.4 and 7.3.4 were treated using log-transformation (factor f of 1).
10 this formula achieves two things: it converts all series into “goods” and scales the series within the range [1, max] so 
that natural logs are positive, starting at 0, where “min” and “max” are the minimum and maximum indicator sample 
values. the corresponding formula for “bads” is:  
ln (max  × f − 1) (max − economy value )
 + 1 max − min

conceptual and practical challenges are inevitable when trying to understand and model the 
fundamentals of innovation at the national level worldwide. now in its 16th edition, the global 
innovation index (gii) 2023, considers these conceptual challenges and deals with practical 
issues relating to data quality and methodological choices.
this appendix summarizes the main conclusions of the audit, conducted for the 13th consecutive 
year by the european commission’s competence centre on composite indicators and 
scoreboards (coin) at the joint research centre (jrc), concerning the statistical soundness 
and assumptions used to arrive at the final index rankings of the gii 2023. the independent 
statistical assessment of the gii provided by the jrc-coin guarantees the transparency and 
reliability of the index for both policymakers and other stakeholders, thus facilitating more 
accurate priority setting and policy formulation in the innovation field.
as in past gii reports, the jrc-coin analysis complements the economy rankings with 
confidence intervals for the gii, the innovation input sub-index and the innovation output sub-
index, in order to allow a better appreciation of the robustness of these rankings to the choice 
of computation methodology. finally, the jrc-coin analysis also includes an assessment of the 
added value of the gii and a measure of “distance to the efficiency frontier” of innovation by 
using data envelopment analysis.
this is a shortened version of the audit. the full audit is available at www.wipo.int/
global_innovation_index/en/2023 .
main conclusions
the jrc-coin analysis suggests that the conceptualized multilevel structure of the gii 2023 – 
with its 80 indicators, 21 sub-pillars, seven pillars and two sub-indices comprising the overall 
index – is statistically sound and balanced: that is, each sub-pillar makes a similar contribution 
to the variation of its respective pillar. the refinements made by the developing team over the 
years have helped to enhance an already strong statistical coherence within the gii framework, 
in which the capacity of the 80 indicators to distinguish between economies’ performances is 
maintained at the sub-pillar level or lower in all but four cases.
the decision not to impute missing values, which is common in comparable contexts and 
justified on the grounds of transparency and replicability, can at times have an undesirable 
impact on some economies’ scores, with the additional negative side-effect that it might 
encourage economies not to report low data values. the gii team’s adoption, in 2016, of a more 
stringent data coverage threshold (at least 66 percent data availability for each of the input- and 
output-related indicators) has notably improved confidence in the economy ranking for the gii 
and the two sub-indices.
additionally, the gii team’s decision, in 2012, to use weights as scaling coefficients during index 
development constitutes a significant departure from the traditional, yet erroneous, vision of 
weights as a reflection of indicators’ importance in a weighted average. it is hoped that such an 
approach will be adopted by other developers of composite indicators to avoid situations where 
bias sneaks in when least expected.
strong correlations between the gii components are proven not to be a sign of redundancy of 
information within the gii. for more than 34 percent (up to 70 percent) of the 132 economies 
included in the gii 2023, the gii ranking and the rankings of any of the seven pillars differ by 
10 positions or more. this demonstrates the added value of the gii ranking, which helps to 
highlight other components of innovation not immediately apparent from a separate analysis 
of each pillar. at the same time, this finding points to there being value in duly considering the 
merits of the gii pillars, sub-pillars and their constituent indicators individually. by doing so, 

global innovation index 2023 221 economy-specific strengths and bottlenecks in innovation can be identified and serve as an 
input for evidence-based policymaking.
to test the impact of the gii modeling assumptions, a number of different models were tested 
in this audit, based on different approaches to imputing of missing data, aggregation at the 
pillar level and assignment of weights. using these models, the 90 percent confidence intervals 
relating to the ranking positions that an economy might have had under different model 
assumptions were computed. for the vast majority of economies, these intervals are sufficiently 
narrow to allow meaningful inferences to be drawn: there is a shift of 10 or fewer positions for 
89 of the 132 economies. however, it is also true that a few economies experience significant 
changes in rank with variations in weights and aggregation formula and when imputing missing 
data. five economies – bahrain, belarus, botswana, brunei darussalam and zimbabwe – have 
90 percent confidence interval widths of more than 20 positions (21, 24, 21, 41 and 21 positions, 
respectively). consequently, their gii rankings (67th, 80th, 85th, 87th and 117th, respectively) in 
the gii classification should be interpreted cautiously and certainly not taken at face value. 
however, this is a remarkable improvement compared to gii versions up to 2016, when more 
than 40 economies had confidence interval widths of more than 20 positions. the improvement 
in the confidence that can be placed in the gii 2023 ranking is the direct result of the decision 
to adopt a more stringent criterion for an economy’s inclusion since 2016, which now requires 
at least 66 percent data availability within each of the two sub-indices. some caution is also 
warranted in regard to the input sub-index for one economy – brunei darussalam – which has a 
90 percent confidence interval width of more than 20 positions (22). a similar degree of caution 
is needed in the output sub-index for three economies – botswana, côte d’ivoire and ghana – 
which have 90 percent confidence interval widths of more than 20 positions (up to 24 for ghana). 
compared to the gii 2019, the higher data availability in the output sub-index this year has led 
to a much lower number of countries with very wide intervals (three compared to 13 in the gii 
2019 edition), which is a noteworthy improvement.
although the rankings for a few economies, in the gii 2023 overall or in the two sub-indices, 
appear to be sensitive to methodological choices, the published rankings for the vast majority 
can be considered as representative of the plurality of scenarios simulated in this audit. taking 
the median rank as the benchmark for an economy’s expected rank in the realm of the gii’s 
unavoidable methodological uncertainties, 80 percent of the economies are found to shift 
fewer than three positions with respect to the median rank in the gii and the input sub-index; 
however, the percentage for the output sub-index is lower, at 62 percent.
in order to offer full transparency and complete information, appendix table 2 reports the 
gii 2023 index and input and output sub-indices’ economy ranks together with the simulated 
90 percent confidence intervals to allow a better appreciation of the robustness of the results 
to the choice of weights and aggregation formula and the impact of estimating missing data 
(where applicable).
all things considered, the present jrc-coin audit findings confirm that the gii 2023 meets 
international quality standards for statistical soundness, which indicates that the gii is a reliable 
benchmarking tool for innovation practices at the economy level around the world.
finally, the “distance to the efficiency frontier” measure, calculated using data envelopment 
analysis, can be used both as a measure of efficiency and as a suitable approach to benchmarking 
economies’ multidimensional performance on innovation, without imposing a fixed and common 
set of weights that may be unfair to a particular economy. the decision made by the gii team to 
abandon the efficiency ratio (ratio of output to input sub-index) is particularly laudable. in fact, 
ratios of composite indicators (output to input sub-index in this case) come with much higher 
uncertainty than the sum of the components (input plus output sub-index, equivalent to the gii). 
for this reason, developers and users of indices alike need to approach efficiency ratios of this 
nature with great care. the gii should not be considered as the ultimate and definitive ranking 
of economies with respect to innovation. on the contrary, the gii best represents an ongoing 
attempt to find metrics and approaches that capture the richness of innovation more effectively, 
continuously adapting the gii framework to reflect the improved availability of statistics and the 
theoretical advances in the field. in any case, the gii should be regarded as a sound attempt, 
based on the principle of transparency, matured over 16 years of constant refinement, to pave the 
way for better and more informed innovation policies worldwide.

global innovation index 2023224 appendix iii
sources and definitions
this appendix complements the economy profiles and the online data tables by providing the 
title, description, definition and source for each of the 80 indicators included in the global 
innovation index (gii) this year.
for all 132 economies in the gii in 2023, the most recent values, within the period 2013 to 2023, 
were used for each indicator.
the year provided next to the indicator description (directly below the indicator title) corresponds 
to the year when data were most frequently available for economies. when more than one year is 
considered, the period used is indicated at the end of the indicator’s source in parentheses.
of the 80 indicators, 64 variables are hard data, 11 are composite indicators, marked with an 
asterisk (*), and five are survey questions from the world economic forum’s executive opinion 
survey (three) and from the global entrepreneurship monitor’s national expert survey (nes) 
(two), marked with a dagger (†). instances marked with a signal indicators that were assigned half 
weights and those marked with b are indicators where higher scores indicate poorer outcomes, 
commonly known as “bads.” appendix i presents more details on the computation.
some indicators are scaled during computation to make them comparable across economies. 
indicators are scaled either in relation to other comparable indicators or through division 
by gross domestic product (gdp) in current us dollars, purchasing power parity gdp in 
international dollars (ppp$ gdp), population, total trade, etc. in all cases, the scaling factor used 
was the value that corresponded to the same year of the indicator.

redundancy costs measure the cost of advance notice requirements and severance 
payments due when terminating a redundant worker’s employment, expressed in weeks 
of salary. the average value of notice requirements and severance payments applicable to 
a worker with one year of tenure, a worker with five years and a worker with 10 years are 
considered. one month is recorded as 4.3 weeks. if the redundancy cost adds up to eight 
or fewer weeks of salary, a value of eight is assigned but the actual number of weeks is 
published. if the cost adds up to more than eight weeks of salary, the score is the number 
of weeks.

2.1.3. school life expectancy, years 
school life expectancy, primary to tertiary education, both sexes (years) | 2020
total number of years that a person of school entrance age can expect to spend within the 
primary to tertiary levels of education. for a child of a given age, the school life expectancy 
is calculated as the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates for primary to tertiary levels of 
education. the part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the 
school-age population for the primary to tertiary level of education in which they are 
enrolled and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. the result is then added 
to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates. a relatively high value indicates a greater 
probability of children spending more years in education and a higher overall retention 
rate within the education system. it must be noted that the expected number of years 
does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed 
due to grade repetition.

2.1.4. pisa scales in reading, maths and science 
pisa scales in reading, mathematics and science | 2018
pisa is the oecd’s  (organisation for economic co-operation and development) 
programme for international student assessment. pisa measures 15-year-olds’ ability to 
use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge skills. results from pisa indicate 
the quality and equity of learning outcomes attained around the world. the 2018 pisa 
survey is the seventh round of the triennial assessment.
the indicator is built using the average of the reading, mathematics and science scores for 
each country. pisa scores are set in relation to the variation in results observed across all 
test participants in a country. there is, theoretically, no minimum or maximum score in 

global innovation index 2023 227 pisa; rather, the results are scaled to fit approximately normal distributions, with means 
around 500 score points and standard deviations around 100 score points.
the 2018 scores for china correspond to the provinces/municipalities of beijing, shanghai, 
jiangsu and zhejiang only. the 2018 scores for azerbaijan correspond only to the capital 
baku. the 2018 average scores for spain are based only on the scores for mathematics and 
science, as the reading scores were not published by the oecd owing to implausible 
student response behavior.

2.1.5. pupil–teacher ratio, secondary 
pupil–teacher ratio, secondaryb | 2020
the number of pupils enrolled in secondary school divided by the number of secondary 
school teachers (regardless of their teaching assignment). where the data are missing for 
the secondary education level as a whole, the ratios for upper-secondary are reported; if 
these are also missing, the ratios for lower-secondary education are reported instead. a 
high pupil–teacher ratio suggests that each teacher has to be responsible for a large 
number of pupils. in other words, the higher the pupil–teacher ratio, the lower the relative 
access of pupils to teachers.

or not at an advanced research qualification level, normally requires, as a minimum 
condition of admission, the successful completion of education at the secondary level. the 
school enrolment ratio can exceed 100 percent due to grade repetition and the inclusion 
of under-aged and over-aged students, who are early or late entrants.

organization can use to enhance its environmental performance. iso 14001 is intended 
for use by an organization that is seeking to manage its environmental responsibilities in a 
systematic manner that contributes to the environmental pillar of sustainability. iso 
14001 helps an organization to achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental 
management system, providing value for the environment, the organization itself and 
interested parties. consistent with the organization’s environmental policy, the intended 
outcomes of an environmental management system include enhancement of 
environmental performance, fulfillment of compliance obligations and achievement of 
environmental objectives. iso 14001 is applicable to any organization, regardless of size, 
type or nature, and applies to the environmental aspects of its activities, products and 
services that the organization determines it can either control or influence from a 
life-cycle perspective. iso  14001 does not state specific environmental performance 
criteria. it can be used in whole or in part to systematically improve environmental 
management. claims of conformity to iso 14001, however, are not acceptable unless all its 
requirements are incorporated into an organization’s environmental management system 
and fulfilled without exclusion. the data are reported per billion ppp$ gdp.

domestic industry diversification (based on manufacturing output)b | 2020
the herfindahl-hirschman index (hhi) for a country’s industry is defined as the sum of 
the squared shares of subsectors in total manufacturing output. the hhi is a measure of 
concentration and can help to determine the extent to which a country’s industrial system 
is diversified across different industrial subsectors (or, conversely, concentrated in a few 
industrial subsectors). a country with a perfectly diversified industrial system will have an 
index close to zero, whereas a country that is active in only one industrial subsector will 
have a value of one (least diversified).

global innovation index 2023 241 sophisticated, specialized capabilities and are therefore able to produce a highly 
diversified set of complex products. determining the economic complexity of a country is 
not solely dependent on a country’s productive knowledge. information about how many 
capabilities the country has is contained not only in the absolute number of products that 
it makes, but also in the ubiquity of those products (the number of countries that import 
those products) and in the sophistication and diversity of the products that those other 
countries make. economic complexity expresses the diversity and sophistication of the 
productive capabilities embedded in the exports of each country.

logos, figures and images, letters, numbers, sounds and moving images. the procedures 
for registering trademarks are governed by the legislation and procedures of national and 
regional ip offices. trademark rights are limited to the jurisdiction of the ip office that 
registers the trademark. trademarks can be registered by filing an application at the 
relevant national or regional office(s) or by filing an international application through the 
madrid system. a resident trademark application refers to an application filed with an ip 
office for or on behalf of the first-named applicant’s country of residence. for example, an 
application filed with the japan patent office by a resident of japan is considered to be a 
resident application for japan. similarly, an application filed with the office for 
harmonization in the internal market (ohim) by an applicant who resides in any of the eu 
member states, such as france, is considered to be a resident application for that member 
state (france). this indicator is based on class count – the total number of goods and 
services classes specified in resident trademark applications. data are scaled by 
ppp$ gdp (billions).

7.1.3. global brand value, top 5,000, % gdp 
global brand value of the top 5,000 brands (% of gdp) | 2023
sum of global brand values, top 5,000 as a percentage of gdp. brand finance calculates 
brand value using the royalty relief methodology, which determines the value that a 
company would be willing to pay to license its brand if it did not own it. the methodology is 
compliant with industry standards set in iso 10668. this approach involves estimating the 
future revenue attributable to a brand and calculating a royalty rate that would be 
charged for the use of the brand. brand finance’s study is based on publicly available 
information on the largest brands in the world. this indicator assesses the economy’s 
brands in the top 5,000 global brand database and produces the sum of the brand values 
corresponding to that economy. this sum is then scaled by gdp. a score of 0 is assigned 
where there are no brands in the country that make the top 5,000 ranking. a score of “n/a” 
is assigned where brand finance has been unable to determine if there are brands from 
the country that would rank within the top 5,000, because of data availability limitations.

an industrial design is a set of exclusive rights granted by law to applicants to protect the 
ornamental or aesthetic aspect of their products. an industrial design is valid for a limited 
period of time and within a defined territory. a resident industrial design application 
refers to an application filed with the ip office for or on behalf of the applicant’s country of 
residence. for example, an application filed with the japan patent office by a resident of 
japan is considered to be a resident application for japan. similarly, an application filed 
with the office for harmonization in the internal market (ohim) by an applicant who 
resides in any of the ohim member states, such as italy, is considered to be a resident 
application for that member state (italy). this indicator is based on design count – the total 
number of designs contained in the resident industrial design applications. data are 
scaled by ppp$ gdp (billions).

7.3.1. generic top-level domains (tlds)/th pop. 15–69 
generic top-level domains (tlds) (per thousand population, 15–69 years old) | 2022
a generic top-level domain (tld) is one of the categories of tlds maintained by the 
internet assigned numbers authority (iana) for use on the internet. generic tlds can be 
unrestricted (.com, .info, .net and .org) or restricted – that is, used on the basis of fulfilling 
eligibility criteria (.biz, .name and .pro). of these, the statistic covers the five generic 
domains .biz, .info, .org, .net and .com. generic domains .name and .pro, and sponsored 
domains (.arpa, .aero, .asia, .cat, .coop, .edu, .gov, .int, .jobs, .mil, .museum, .tel and .travel) 
are not included. neither are country-code top-level domains (refer to indicator 7.3.2). the 
statistic represents the total number of registered domains (i.e., net totals as of december 
2021, existing domains + new registrations – expired domains). data are collected on the 
basis of a 4 percent random sample of the total population of domains drawn from the 
root zone files (a complete listing of active domains) for each tld. the geographic location 
of a domain is determined by the registration address for the domain name registrant that 
is returned from a whois query. these registration data are parsed by country and postal 
code and then aggregated to the required geographic levels, such as county, city or 
economy. the original hard data were scaled by thousand population, 15–69 years old. for 
confidentiality reasons, only normalized values are reported; while relative positions are 
preserved, magnitudes are not.

country-code top-level domains (tlds) (per thousand population, 15–69 years old) | 2022
a country-code top-level domain (tld) is one of the categories of tlds maintained by the 
internet assigned numbers authority  (iana) for use on the internet. country-code tlds 
are two-letter domains especially designated for a particular economy, country or 
autonomous territory. the statistic represents the total number of registered domains 
(i.e., net totals as of december 2021, existing domains + new registrations – expired 
domains). data are collected from the registry responsible for each country-code tld and 
represent the total number of domain registrations in the country-code tld. each 
country-code tld is assigned to the country with which it is associated rather than based 
on the registration address of the registrant. zooknic reports that, for the country-code 
tlds it covers, 85–100 percent of domains are registered in the same country; the only 
exceptions are the country-code tlds that have been licensed for worldwide commercial 
use. data are reported per thousand population, 15–69 years old. for confidentiality 
reasons, only normalized values are reported; while relative positions are preserved, 
magnitudes are not.

github is the world’s largest host of source code and a commit is the term used for a 
change on this platform. one or more commits can be saved (or pushed) to projects (or 
repositories). thus, “github commit pushes received and sent” refers to the sum of the 
number of batched changes received and sent by projects on github that are publicly 
available within a specific economy. automated activity resulting in non-productive 
commits is excluded.

global innovation index 2023246 appendix iv
global innovation index science and technology  
cluster methodology
since 2016, the global innovation index (gii) has sought to identify science and technology (s&t) 
clusters using a bottom-up approach. this approach disregards administrative or political 
borders and instead pinpoints those geographical areas that show a high density of inventors 
and scientific authors. the resulting clusters often encompass several municipal districts, sub-
federal states and sometimes even two or more countries. two innovation metrics are employed 
in the compilation of the top 100 gii s&t clusters worldwide: location of inventors listed on 
published patent applications and authors listed on published scientific articles.
for patents, this method relies on applications under wipo’s patent cooperation treaty (pct). 
pct patents offer a useful basis for analyzing patents globally. the pct system applies a single 
set of procedural rules and collects information based on uniform filing standards. this reduces 
potential biases that could arise from using data collected from multiple national sources. the 
patents selected were published over the most recent five-year period available, between 2018 
and 2022, to minimize the effects of volatility that can occur between years.1
to widen the range of innovation included, scientific publications from the web of science’s 
science citation index expanded (scie) are incorporated. the scie provides detailed coverage 
of the world’s most impactful academic journals. for the analysis presented here, science and 
technology fields are the focus, while articles from the fields of social sciences and humanities 
are disregarded. in addition, scientific publications are limited solely to articles of original 
research. this excludes other published items, such as meeting abstracts, conference summaries 
or paper briefs. as with pct filings, the most recent five-year period according to data availability 
was also used for the scie – publication years 2017 to 2021.
the wipo pct patent data set consists of approximately 1.3 million patent applications published 
between 2018 and 2022, containing 3.9 million inventor addresses. for the scie, the data set 
comprises 7.6 million articles published between 2017 and 2021, containing 25.1 million listed 
author addresses.
the process for geocoding of addresses for this report is as follows. pct inventor addresses were 
geocoded using the environmental systems research institute (esri) arcgis world geocoder 
service.2 in cases where the esri address matches proved either ambiguous or insufficiently 
accurate, the city name in the address string was extracted and matched using records in the 
city-level data set from the geonames gazetteer database.3 this latter database gives the 
geolocation of cities around the globe and contains 48,000 geocoded cities. this same city-
matching approach was applied to all scie author addresses.
overall, 97.6 percent of inventor addresses were geocoded at either the city level or a more 
accurate level, while 95.7 percent of scientific author addresses were geocoded at the city level. 
appendix table 5 provides a summary of the geocoding results for the top 20 countries, which 
together account for the majority of inventor and scientific author addresses. as shown in the 
table, the coverage of geocoded pct inventor addresses across all 20 countries is typically above 
98 percent, only falling below 98 percent in one instance. coverage of scientific author addresses 
is also high, above 90% in all but one instance. all of the 20 countries had at least 95 percent 
of their pct applications and scientific articles contain at least one inventor or author with a 
geocoded address, only falling below 95 percent in one instance.
addresses were clustered by applying the density-based spatial clustering of applications with 
noise (dbscan) algorithm. this algorithm requires predefined radius and density parameters. as 
in previous years, a radius of 15 km and a density of 4,500 listed inventors/authors was applied. 
equal weight was given to inventors and authors by expressing data points as a share of total 
inventor and author addresses, respectively. given that the number of scientific articles far 
exceeds the number of patents, cluster identification based on the raw data points would have 
resulted in clusters shaped predominantly by the scientific author landscape.
the result was an initial list of 248 clusters. after review, neighboring clusters were merged 
if the edge of one cluster was within 3–5 km of another and where the co-author/co-inventor 

global innovation index 2023 247 relationships were higher than for any other relationship with any other cluster or non-cluster 
points. a total of 22 clusters met these criteria, with mergers reducing the overall number of 
clusters identified to 237.4
the remaining 237 clusters were then ranked by counting the number of patents and scientific 
articles in a given cluster. numbers were aggregated using fractional counting, in which counts 
reflect the share of a patent’s inventors and an article’s authors present in a particular cluster. in 
addition, mirroring the equal weighting approach described above, fractional counts are relative 
to the total numbers of patents and scientific articles.
to produce an intensity ranking, the european commission’s global human settlement 
layer (ghsl) population distribution data were matched geographically to the top 100 
clusters identified in the overall ranking.5 just as with inventor/author geocoded locations, 
these population data allowed us to define the total population of a cluster using a bottom-
up approach. we chose to define a cluster’s area as all the space within 0.05 degrees of each 
inventor/author location. overlaying the resultant cluster polygons on top of the population data 
and aggregating all points which lay within each polygon gave a total population estimate for 
each cluster.6 the clusters were then ranked by dividing the total s&t share by population.

wipo.intthe global innovation index 2023  (gii) takes the pulse of 
innovation against a background of an economic and geopolitical 
environment fraught with uncertainty.
tracking the most recent global innovation trends, the gii finds 
that – despite a climate of disquiet and a decline in risk capital 
investment – opportunities abound as a result of the incipient 
digital age  and deep science  innovation waves.
at its core, the gii 2023 reveals who is leading in global 
innovation, ranking the innovation performance of 132 economies 
and highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. in addition, it 
identifies the world’s top 100 science and technology clusters.
the gii is a “tool for action” regarding innovation policy. 
governments around the world have used the gii to benchmark 
innovation performance, perfect innovation metrics and, 
ultimately, to shape evidence-based innovation policymaking.
in the context of the united nations sustainable development 
goals (sdgs), since 2019, the gii has been recognized by the 
united nations general assembly to be a benchmark for 
measuring innovation, including more recently in a post-pandemic 
environment.
