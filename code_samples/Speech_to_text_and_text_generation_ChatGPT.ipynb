Improve your STEM skills while having a great time learning at brilliant.org for a slasher visual politic EN. More on that in a bit. Here is the million dollar question in Europe. Why is there no European Google? Why does Europe seem to be an elephant's graveyard when it comes to business? To give you an idea of the five largest companies in the world, four are American and were launched after 1975. In Europe, however, it is common for the largest companies to have been started much earlier. Some, such as Nestle, date back to the 19th century, and even the pharmaceutical companies that created a giant like Novartis were started in the 17th and 18th centuries, no less. Let's see, credit where credit's due, these companies deserve a round of applause for having managed to survive in the market. But it's significant that no young European company is in this top five while in the 90's states, three of the five largest companies are younger than many of you watching this video. This indicates one thing. The USA is way ahead of Europe in terms of innovation. This does not mean that there are no companies in Europe that have not been innovative. SAP, which is a programme used by accountants in large companies, are Skype, which we all know, were conceived in Germany and Estonia. But they aren't much when compared to the United States. Until now, this was one more debate among many in Europe. But now, it is the most important debate that will be raised in the coming years. And that is because of the energy crisis. The current crisis is affecting all citizens with stratospheric electricity bills. But do you know who else is affected by these price increases? You guessed, if visual politics viewers, the companies, many of which may flee from a dying European Union, that no longer offers them low-cost gas. The European Union is no longer more competitive than the United States or China. In a few years' time, we could be talking about the European Union as a continental Detroit. In fact, as was the case in Detroit, the automotive industry is extremely important throughout Europe and not only in France and Germany. In Spain, for example, the automotive industry accounted for almost 8% of the entire GDP in 2020. In other words, the comparison with Detroit is no joke. And if you are a loyal follower to this channel, you will already know what it means to be Detroit, unemployment, slums and cranes. So how can this trend be changed? How could Europe move closer to the Silicon Valley model? Could the war in Ukraine revive the European Union? Today we're going to answer all these questions. But before we continue, whether you're trying to develop your professional skills or broaden your understanding of the world, we recommend checking out today's sponsor, Brilliant. Brilliant is a problem-solving based website and app with a hands-on approach. It's a better way to learn. They've got over 70 interactive courses in maths, science and computer science, and it doesn't matter whether you're a student looking to get ahead, or a professional keen on building new skills. You have to check out Brilliant. It's excellent. Maybe you've always wanted to learn about statistics, and trust me, statistics can be tricky and lead you to dubious conclusions. And no, just in case you were wondering, the fact that one out every five babies born on earth or Chinese does not mean that your fifth child will be Chinese. But jokes aside, there are lots of great stuff on their platform, including daily challenges which are a great way to flex our grey matter every day. So don't wait any longer, and let Brilliant help you master even complex technical subjects by clicking on the link below. You'll get started for free and hurry. The first 200 people get 20% off an annual premium subscription. And now, let's get cracking. History of Two Places A visual politic had existed in the 1950s, there would be two places we'd be talking about nonstop. Silicon Valley and Detroit. And you may be wondering, what do you mean Detroit? Well, yes, in the 1950s, Detroit was mainly home to a large automobile industry with a well-known brand such as Ford and Chevrolet. In fact, a lot of people started to move there, just as they stood to Silicon Valley, with the population reaching almost two million people. Meanwhile, the other successful sister city in the United States from 1950s onwards was, and still is, Silicon Valley. Can you tell me where the initial success of this valley was to be found? Well, for those of you who don't know, it was no less than, in the war. You heard correctly. During World War II, the United States was focused on fighting Japan in the Pacific. So California started getting a lot of investment and workers to open all kinds of factories and businesses who supply the military effort. So you could say that Silicon Valley was in the right place at the right time. Not only was it located in California, but it also had a large university community in Palo Alto, and therefore highly qualified professionals. And, as war not only demanded commodities, but also technologies that were very advanced for the time, suddenly, this place started to take off. For example, many, many companies began to develop new semiconductors for bombs here. And so what would later become known as Silicon Valley became a key player during the war. But that seed soon sprouted, because Silicon Valley was a particularly fertile ground for companies. And one of those responsible for this entrepreneurial fertility was the man you see on the screen right now. We are talking about Professor Frederick Terman, the father of the connection between universities and private enterprise. Terman understood that universities produce knowledge, but it is the entrepreneurs who convert this development into innovation. That is, into products that are useful to society. With this idea in mind, he worked tirelessly to open the university to companies and strengthen ties with them. In line with his vision, companies would finance and promote the university's research projects, which would give the university many more resources and a guide of where to go. On the other hand, collaboration with the university would allow companies to grow faster, and therefore, eventually have more resources. And so the cycle continued. However, in order to get the whole process started, we are still missing a key factor, something that entrepreneurs desperately need. So, the million dollar question is, what could it be that these entrepreneurs needed funding? And that's where this other gentleman you see on the screen stepped in. Lawrence Rockefeller, the creator of Silicon Valley's first venture capital fund, Venrock Associated. The rest is history. To put it another way, Silicon Valley's success is not due to the fact that it has many entrepreneurs. There are entrepreneurs everywhere. The difference is that in Silicon Valley, the conditions are right for a company to start from scratch and end up listed on Wall Street within just a few years. This is the story of Google, Facebook, Apple, and so many other companies that have changed our lives. But the question is, what does Silicon Valley have that does not exist in Europe? Flexibility comes first. What happens if you want to work for two competing companies at the same time? No problem. However, if you want to fire someone who is not being profitable and hire someone else, go ahead. But that's not all. There are two additional key factors in Silicon Valley. University Industry Collaboration and Venture Capital. On the other hand, we have Detroit. Detroit is the capital of the automobile. A very mature industry where there is hardly any disruptive innovation. Better cars can be made, but there are still cars. So companies like Ford, Chevrolet, and General Motors, which were started at the beginning of the 20th century, continue to do what they knew how to do. Cars. And it didn't take long for them to encounter a fierce competitor offering cheaper, but just as good cars. Japanese companies. Companies like Toyota began to dominate the US car market. Toyota Corolla. What's more, Detroit was left behind. A host of union, tax, and regulatory problems of all kinds, along with ever increasing crime rates and growing competition from new Asian brands, caused American companies to begin closing their factories in the city. Because, plain and simple, they were no longer competitive. In fact, the debacle was of such intensity that the city once home to nearly two million people, now struggles to maintain a major 670,000 inhabitants. As you can see, both Silicon Valley and Detroit started out booming like no other territory, but only one is managed to survive. And the key has been what we've already mentioned. Innovation. Well, in a way, we could say that the European Union today faces a very similar threat. Over the years, regulations, attacks, and labour policies have eroded the competitiveness of established businesses. And now, the energy crisis threatens to be something of a final straw. This is a problem above all, because in Europe, basically and simplistically, you could say that almost nothing new is being produced. So, it is fair to ask, is Europe heading the same way as Detroit? Old Europe. Pay close attention to the following graph. As you can see, Europe not only spends much less on defence of the United States, but also the spending is highly fragmented by country, and almost all of it goes to salaries and current expenses. In other words, there is little left to invest in R&D and the development of new military programs. To let say that Europe does not have one of the drivers of innovation, that the United States does. And here we have to keep one thing in mind, whether you are for or against military investment, unlike other types of public spending, it is mostly an investment in highly applied technologies, and that shows. But not only that, even if all European militaries were to agree to develop a joint weapon, for example, a new missile system, they would encounter a huge problem. Most European universities are forbidden to collaborate on military projects, just as you heard. In the internal regulations of many universities, it is forbidden to do research for military matters, nor can it be said that they are willing to collaborate with private companies easily. And this is a problem. Remember that most military innovation ends up having civilian applications, take the example of GPS or the internet itself. And of course, we are not only talking about military spending, and to this the fact that European universities are more oriented towards teaching than research. We have talked about this on previous visual-politic videos. Universities in the United States are extremely expensive. However, that has an advantage. They generate results. So Europe does not have this other driver of American innovation either. To make matters worse, the European Union is a regulation machine. Practically, its main job is to regulate everything that can be regulated, which makes innovation very difficult. For example, it is already working on regulating artificial intelligence. So companies that want to start researching will have to face a lot of obstacles and requirements of all kinds. Then, drugs are another good example. Regulations are so intense that it can take decades for companies to bring out new medicines. Barely any investment in military technology, universities reluctant to collaborate, and with a lot of regulation, let's say that we could summarise the general feeling in this sentence. Since we cannot be leaders in innovation, let's be leaders in regulation. Statement of an anonymous MEP to visual-politic. Union regulations may actually repel investment in its innovation. Of course, there are always exceptions. In Europe, for example, companies such as SAP, the Business Management Software giant, have been born. If you work in a large company, you will surely be familiar with it. But it is curious that one of the largest venture capital funds, Sequoia Capital, does not even have offices in the European Union. They are present in the United States, the UK, India, and China, but they haven't even bothered to open offices in any EU capital. And that illustrates why Europe today has hardly any unicorns. Unicorns are startups that are worth at least $1 billion. And I'm sure you can guess where most of them come wrong. That's right, the United States. The country that has produced the most unicorns are whopping 487. This is followed by China with 301, and we have to go to the fifth place of countries with the most unicorns to find a country within the European Union, Germany with 26 unicorns. And you may be wondering, isn't there any country in the European Union that resembles Silicon Valley? Well, perhaps the most similar case is Estonia. Here on VisualPolitik, we have several videos where we explain in depth the Estonian model. It's a country that is sought to move away from almost all of the policies that prevail in Europe. For example, it's created a very attractive tax framework for companies, has developed its digital infrastructure beyond any other, and has fought hard to limit regulations, or at least make compliance with them easier. So what's the problem? It's an extremely small country with only a little over 1 million inhabitants. So obviously, its influence is very limited. So, has Europe been resting on its laurels? Not interested in getting a Silicon Valley of its own? Well, VisualPolitik viewers, that didn't seem to matter to the European Union until not so long ago. As long as Russian gas flowed smoothly to the European Union, and particularly to Germany, companies would remain competitive, and the territory attractive for investment precisely because of its low energy prices. Let's just say that cheap energy was making up for all the other factors. However, gas prices have skyrocketed, and now most of the gas is liquefied and does not come from Russia, which means paying much more for that energy source. And so now, the risk of companies leaving has multiplied. VisualPolitik Community, the European Union is starting to look for a way to become competitive again with the United States and China. The question is, how will it do it? Will it try to create its own Silicon Valley? Is this option really possible? We'll pay attention, because the European Union has a golden opportunity. A new beginning? Do you know how many European unicorns are in the top 10? You guessed it. Indeed, in the list of the top 10 unicorns is dominated to no one's surprise by China and the United States. Despite this absence, it cannot be said that the European Union has not tried. Since 2008, several programs have been launched to finance R&D and boost innovation. And of course, many of the R&D projects paid for with European funds are interesting. However, most of them usually remain a nice academic paper. They never materialize into products that make a difference, and that can be bought and sold on the markets. Among other things, because public programs tend to be very rigid, very bureaucratic, and almost never focused on the market itself. The fact that a civil servant or a bureaucrat is responsible for selecting the projects to be financed does not seem to be a cutting-edge strategy. In fact, one of the most successful countries in recent decades has been Israel. What they did was take these bureaucrats out of the formula. They made public funding, complement private funding, and therefore it was the latter that was in charge of selecting the projects that then had to be put their own money into. However, stay tuned, because this situation in Europe could change for one simple reason. The war in Ukraine. After Putin decided to invade Ukraine, EU states reacted with increased military spending. We found news like this. Germany reverses defense policy with historic military investment increase in response to Putin's war. Suddenly, all European states are going to double their military spending. It seems this new military spending is going to go through three phases in the European Union. The initial one of fine-tuning all the military assets in place, no more broomsticks. Yikes! Germany's army is so under-equipped that it used broomsticks instead of machine guns. A second phase would be the renewal of outdated equipment. In other words, buying F-35s from the US as if there was no tomorrow. And finally, a third phase of development of their own armament. This is very important, because in this aspect, the development of new technologies is fundamental. In fact, this could be the seed that Europe needs for a Silicon Valley to blossom. As taken Europe to enter into a crisis and unite against an enemy for its high representative, Josep Borrell, to be heated. Either we invest heavily in defence innovation, or we will become defensively irrelevant. Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for foreign policy. The problem? Europe has 27 different armies, and it takes huge sums of money to create a fighter jet or tank that compete with those of the US. There are several European Union programmes to facilitate R&D between organisations in different countries, but the results have been rather modest. What could be the solution? Joint projects between two, three or more countries. This was the formula with Switzchum's relatively successful projects were created, such as the Eurofighter or the Euro-Dron. Even companies like Airbus, which has a very significant military division, emerged with the collaboration of several states. In this case, we could see several European nations coming together to make a public competition to design a new fighter jet or a new cyber security system. Being several states, they can invest much more money. Well, the fact is that this new flood of money into military research could end up supporting, as it did in Santa Clara, the emergence of new high-tech clusters. In this sense, military research has several advantages over other types of public spending. Firstly, the development of applied research is sought. In other words, money is spent with the clear intention of creating new products and technologies to be used for specific products and services. Secondly, military research relies on private companies and is closely linked to industrial processes. And thirdly, the ability to export this technology is usually taken into account. This is because the military industrial process is very capital intensive and for a new development to be profitable, it usually needs to be mass-produced. Well, these three major advantages mean that military spending tends to be relatively efficient, at least more so than other types of spending when it comes to boosting a technology industry. Of course, it is not enough on its own, more is needed. But what needs to change in Europe for all this money to be translated into innovative companies? Mainly, two elements are needed. Firstly, it is important that the states are willing to cooperate in defence, and that is not easy. Let's give an example. Imagine that Spain, France and Italy got together to develop an artificial intelligence project. Where will the factory be set up? Which university will do most of the research? Would France really be willing to pay to finance a project that will create jobs in another country? These kinds of discussions can delay projects for years, and they end up generating all sorts of cost overruns. Secondly, it is essential for universities to be able to participate in defence projects. European universities have to get used to working with private companies. And thirdly, Europe needs to relax many of the regulations that currently hinder this type of activity. One idea could be create a special economic zone following the model proposed by Liz Trust in the United Kingdom. Economic zones where urban planning rules, business rules or taxes are relaxed or better adapted to the reality of this industry. This could make it possible to turn the military race into a new Silicon Valley's threat to Europe. Now the questions though are over to you. Will Europe see a Silicon Valley or will Europe's declarations just fine words? Will this compensate for the loss of competitiveness due to higher energy prices? Will the European Union manage to avoid having several many Silicon Valley's, or will it end up becoming a gigantic a destroyed instead? You can leave me your answers in the comments below.

Improve your STEM skills while having a great time learning at brilliant.org for a slasher visual politic EN. More on that in a bit. Here is the million dollar question in Europe. Why is there no European Google? Why does Europe seem to be an elephant's graveyard when it comes to business? To give you an idea of the five largest companies in the world, four are American and were launched after 1975. In Europe, however, it is common for the largest companies to have been started much earlier. Some, such as Nestle, date back to the 19th century, and even the pharmaceutical companies that created a giant like Novartis were started in the 17th and 18th centuries, no less. Let's see, credit where credit's due, these companies deserve a round of applause for having managed to survive in the market. But it's significant that no young European company is in this top five while in the 90's states, three of the five largest companies are younger than many of you watching this video. This indicates one thing. The USA is way ahead of Europe in terms of innovation. This does not mean that there are no companies in Europe that have not been innovative. SAP, which is a programme used by accountants in large companies, are Skype, which we all know, were conceived in Germany and Estonia. But they aren't much when compared to the United States. Until now, this was one more debate among many in Europe. But now, it is the most important debate that will be raised in the coming years. And that is because of the energy crisis. The current crisis is affecting all citizens with stratospheric electricity bills. But do you know who else is affected by these price increases? You guessed, if visual politics viewers, the companies, many of which may flee from a dying European Union, that no longer offers them low-cost gas. The European Union is no longer more competitive than the United States or China. In a few years' time, we could be talking about the European Union as a continental Detroit. In fact, as was the case in Detroit, the automotive industry is extremely important throughout Europe and not only in France and Germany. In Spain, for example, the automotive industry accounted for almost 8% of the entire GDP in 2020. In other words, the comparison with Detroit is no joke. And if you are a loyal follower to this channel, you will already know what it means to be Detroit, unemployment, slums and cranes. So how can this trend be changed? How could Europe move closer to the Silicon Valley model? Could the war in Ukraine revive the European Union? Today we're going to answer all these questions. But before we continue, whether you're trying to develop your professional skills or broaden your understanding of the world, we recommend checking out today's sponsor, Brilliant.

History of Two Places A visual politic had existed in the 1950s, there would be two places we'd be talking about nonstop. Silicon Valley and Detroit. And you may be wondering, what do you mean Detroit? Well, yes, in the 1950s, Detroit was mainly home to a large automobile industry with a well-known brand such as Ford and Chevrolet. In fact, a lot of people started to move there, just as they stood to Silicon Valley, with the population reaching almost two million people. Meanwhile, the other successful sister city in the United States from 1950s onwards was, and still is, Silicon Valley. Can you tell me where the initial success of this valley was to be found? Well, for those of you who don't know, it was no less than, in the war. You heard correctly. During World War II, the United States was focused on fighting Japan in the Pacific. So California started getting a lot of investment and workers to open all kinds of factories and businesses who supply the military effort. So you could say that Silicon Valley was in the right place at the right time. Not only was it located in California, but it also had a large university community in Palo Alto, and therefore highly qualified professionals. And, as war not only demanded commodities, but also technologies that were very advanced for the time, suddenly, this place started to take off. For example, many, many companies began to develop new semiconductors for bombs here. And so what would later become known as Silicon Valley became a key player during the war. But that seed soon sprouted, because Silicon Valley was a particularly fertile ground for companies. And one of those responsible for this entrepreneurial fertility was the man you see on the screen right now. We are talking about Professor Frederick Terman, the father of the connection between universities and private enterprise. Terman understood that universities produce knowledge, but it is the entrepreneurs who convert this development into innovation. That is, into products that are useful to society. With this idea in mind, he worked tirelessly to open the university to companies and strengthen ties with them. In line with his vision, companies would finance and promote the university's research projects, which would give the university many more resources and a guide of where to go. On the other hand, collaboration with the university would allow companies to grow faster, and therefore, eventually have more resources. And so the cycle continued. However, in order to get the whole process started, we are still missing a key factor, something that entrepreneurs desperately need. So, the million dollar question is, what could it be that these entrepreneurs needed funding? And that's where this other gentleman you see on the screen stepped in. Lawrence Rockefeller, the creator of Silicon Valley's first venture capital fund, Venrock Associated. The rest is history. To put it another way, Silicon Valley's success is not due to the fact that it has many entrepreneurs. There are entrepreneurs everywhere. The difference is that in Silicon Valley, the conditions are right for a company to start from scratch and end up listed on Wall Street within just a few years. This is the story of Google, Facebook, Apple, and so many other companies that have changed our lives. But the question is, what does Silicon Valley have that does not exist in Europe? Flexibility comes first. What happens if you want to work for two competing companies at the same time? No problem. However, if you want to fire someone who is not being profitable and hire someone else, go ahead. But that's not all. There are two additional key factors in Silicon Valley. University Industry Collaboration and Venture Capital. On the other hand, we have Detroit. Detroit is the capital of the automobile. A very mature industry where there is hardly any disruptive innovation. Better cars can be made, but there are still cars. So companies like Ford, Chevrolet, and General Motors, which were started at the beginning of the 20th century, continue to do what they knew how to do. Cars. And it didn't take long for them to encounter a fierce competitor offering cheaper, but just as good cars. Japanese companies. Companies like Toyota began to dominate the US car market. Toyota Corolla. What's more, Detroit was left behind. A host of union, tax, and regulatory problems of all kinds, along with ever increasing crime rates and growing competition from new Asian brands, caused American companies to begin closing their factories in the city. Because, plain and simple, they were no longer competitive. In fact, the debacle was of such intensity that the city once home to nearly two million people, now struggles to maintain a major 670,000 inhabitants. As you can see, both Silicon Valley and Detroit started out booming like no other territory, but only one is managed to survive. And the key has been what we've already mentioned. Innovation. Well, in a way, we could say that the European Union today faces a very similar threat. Over the years, regulations, attacks, and labour policies have eroded the competitiveness of established businesses. And now, the energy crisis threatens to be something of a final straw. This is a problem above all, because in Europe, basically and simplistically, you could say that almost nothing new is being produced. So, it is fair to ask, is Europe heading the same way as Detroit? Old Europe. Pay close attention to the following graph. As you can see, Europe not only spends much less on defence of the United States, but also the spending is highly fragmented by country, and almost all of it goes to salaries and current expenses. In other words, there is little left to invest in R&D and the development of new military programs. To let say that Europe does not have one of the drivers of innovation, that the United States does. And here we have to keep one thing in mind, whether you are for or against military investment, unlike other types of public spending, it is mostly an investment in highly applied technologies, and that shows. But not only that, even if all European militaries were to agree to develop a joint weapon, for example, a new missile system, they would encounter a huge problem. Most European universities are forbidden to collaborate on military projects, just as you heard. In the internal regulations of many universities, it is forbidden to do research for military matters, nor can it be said that they are willing to collaborate with private companies easily. And this is a problem. Remember that most military innovation ends up having civilian applications, take the example of GPS or the internet itself. And of course, we are not only talking about military spending, and to this the fact that European universities are more oriented towards teaching than research. We have talked about this on previous visual-politic videos. Universities in the United States are extremely expensive. However, that has an advantage. They generate results. So Europe does not have this other driver of American innovation either. To make matters worse, the European Union is a regulation machine. Practically, its main job is to regulate everything that can be regulated, which makes innovation very difficult. For example, it is already working on regulating artificial intelligence. So companies that want to start researching will have to face a lot of obstacles and requirements of all kinds. Then, drugs are another good example. Regulations are so intense that it can take decades for companies to bring out new medicines. Barely any investment in military technology, universities reluctant to collaborate, and with a lot of regulation, let's say that we could summarise the general feeling in this sentence. Since we cannot be leaders in innovation, let's be leaders in regulation. Statement of an anonymous MEP to visual-politic. Union regulations may actually repel investment in its innovation. Of course, there are always exceptions. In Europe, for example, companies such as SAP, the Business Management Software giant, have been born. If you work in a large company, you will surely be familiar with it. But it is curious that one of the largest venture capital funds, Sequoia Capital, does not even have offices in the European Union. They are present in the United States, the UK, India, and China, but they haven't even bothered to open offices in any EU capital. And that illustrates why Europe today has hardly any unicorns. Unicorns are startups that are worth at least $1 billion. And I'm sure you can guess where most of them come wrong. That's right, the United States. The country that has produced the most unicorns are whopping 487. This is followed by China with 301, and we have to go to the fifth place of countries with the most unicorns to find a country within the European Union, Germany with 26 unicorns. And you may be wondering, isn't there any country in the European Union that resembles Silicon Valley? Well, perhaps the most similar case is Estonia. Here on VisualPolitik, we have several videos where we explain in depth the Estonian model. It's a country that is sought to move away from almost all of the policies that prevail in Europe. For example, it's created a very attractive tax framework for companies, has developed its digital infrastructure beyond any other, and has fought hard to limit regulations, or at least make compliance with them easier. So what's the problem? It's an extremely small country with only a little over 1 million inhabitants. So obviously, its influence is very limited. So, has Europe been resting on its laurels? Not interested in getting a Silicon Valley of its own? Well, VisualPolitik viewers, that didn't seem to matter to the European Union until not so long ago. As long as Russian gas flowed smoothly to the European Union, and particularly to Germany, companies would remain competitive, and the territory attractive for investment precisely because of its low energy prices. Let's just say that cheap energy was making up for all the other factors. However, gas prices have skyrocketed, and now most of the gas is liquefied and does not come from Russia, which means paying much more for that energy source. And so now, the risk of companies leaving has multiplied. VisualPolitik Community, the European Union is starting to look for a way to become competitive again with the United States and China. The question is, how will it do it? Will it try to create its own Silicon Valley? Is this option really possible? We'll pay attention, because the European Union has a golden opportunity. A new beginning? Do you know how many European unicorns are in the top 10? You guessed it. Indeed, in the list of the top 10 unicorns is dominated to no one's surprise by China and the United States. Despite this absence, it cannot be said that the European Union has not tried. Since 2008, several programs have been launched to finance R&D and boost innovation. And of course, many of the R&D projects paid for with European funds are interesting. However, most of them usually remain a nice academic paper. They never materialize into products that make a difference, and that can be bought and sold on the markets. Among other things, because public programs tend to be very rigid, very bureaucratic, and almost never focused on the market itself. The fact that a civil servant or a bureaucrat is responsible for selecting the projects to be financed does not seem to be a cutting-edge strategy. In fact, one of the most successful countries in recent decades has been Israel. What they did was take these bureaucrats out of the formula. They made public funding, complement private funding, and therefore it was the latter that was in charge of selecting the projects that then had to be put their own money into. However, stay tuned, because this situation in Europe could change for one simple reason. The war in Ukraine. After Putin decided to invade Ukraine, EU states reacted with increased military spending. We found news like this. Germany reverses defense policy with historic military investment increase in response to Putin's war. Suddenly, all European states are going to double their military spending. It seems this new military spending is going to go through three phases in the European Union. The initial one of fine-tuning all the military assets in place, no more broomsticks. Yikes! Germany's army is so under-equipped that it used broomsticks instead of machine guns. A second phase would be the renewal of outdated equipment. In other words, buying F-35s from the US as if there was no tomorrow. And finally, a third phase of development of their own armament. This is very important, because in this aspect, the development of new technologies is fundamental. In fact, this could be the seed that Europe needs for a Silicon Valley to blossom. As taken Europe to enter into a crisis and unite against an enemy for its high representative, Josep Borrell, to be heated. Either we invest heavily in defence innovation, or we will become defensively irrelevant. Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for foreign policy. The problem? Europe has 27 different armies, and it takes huge sums of money to create a fighter jet or tank that compete with those of the US. There are several European Union programmes to facilitate R&D between organisations in different countries, but the results have been rather modest. What could be the solution? Joint projects between two, three or more countries. This was the formula with Switzchum's relatively successful projects were created, such as the Eurofighter or the Euro-Dron. Even companies like Airbus, which has a very significant military division, emerged with the collaboration of several states. In this case, we could see several European nations coming together to make a public competition to design a new fighter jet or a new cyber security system. Being several states, they can invest much more money. Well, the fact is that this new flood of money into military research could end up supporting, as it did in Santa Clara, the emergence of new high-tech clusters. In this sense, military research has several advantages over other types of public spending. Firstly, the development of applied research is sought. In other words, money is spent with the clear intention of creating new products and technologies to be used for specific products and services. Secondly, military research relies on private companies and is closely linked to industrial processes. And thirdly, the ability to export this technology is usually taken into account. This is because the military industrial process is very capital intensive and for a new development to be profitable, it usually needs to be mass-produced. Well, these three major advantages mean that military spending tends to be relatively efficient, at least more so than other types of spending when it comes to boosting a technology industry. Of course, it is not enough on its own, more is needed. But what needs to change in Europe for all this money to be translated into innovative companies? Mainly, two elements are needed. Firstly, it is important that the states are willing to cooperate in defence, and that is not easy. Let's give an example. Imagine that Spain, France and Italy got together to develop an artificial intelligence project. Where will the factory be set up? Which university will do most of the research? Would France really be willing to pay to finance a project that will create jobs in another country? These kinds of discussions can delay projects for years, and they end up generating all sorts of cost overruns. Secondly, it is essential for universities to be able to participate in defence projects. European universities have to get used to working with private companies. And thirdly, Europe needs to relax many of the regulations that currently hinder this type of activity. One idea could be create a special economic zone following the model proposed by Liz Trust in the United Kingdom. Economic zones where urban planning rules, business rules or taxes are relaxed or better adapted to the reality of this industry. This could make it possible to turn the military race into a new Silicon Valley's threat to Europe. Now the questions though are over to you. Will Europe see a Silicon Valley or will Europe's declarations just fine words? Will this compensate for the loss of competitiveness due to higher energy prices? Will the European Union manage to avoid having several many Silicon Valley's, or will it end up becoming a gigantic a destroyed instead? You can leave me your answers in the comments below.
